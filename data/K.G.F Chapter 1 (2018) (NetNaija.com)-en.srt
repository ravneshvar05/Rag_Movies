1
00:02:10,145 --> 00:02:12,475
I had heard of demons...

2
00:02:12,685 --> 00:02:14,645
For the first time I saw one!

3
00:02:16,265 --> 00:02:19,395
No one should write or read about him!

4
00:02:21,855 --> 00:02:23,315
There should be no trace of him

5
00:02:23,315 --> 00:02:25,515
in the annals of history!

6
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:28,815
I am enforcing the Army

7
00:02:30,315 --> 00:02:31,935
and signing a Death Warrant

8
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:34,355
of the biggest criminal in India!

9
00:02:44,645 --> 00:02:46,435
This is ridiculous...

10
00:02:46,565 --> 00:02:48,895
How can somebody write something so careless...??

11
00:02:49,315 --> 00:02:50,855
That too a Senior Journalist,

12
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:51,895
if he writes like this,

13
00:02:51,895 --> 00:02:53,065
I am unable to believe it!

14
00:02:53,265 --> 00:02:55,185
They wanted to publish this book too!

15
00:02:55,605 --> 00:02:56,725
But the Government...

16
00:02:56,725 --> 00:02:58,895
has banned this book then after seizing it,

17
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,515
they burnt all the copies...

18
00:03:00,765 --> 00:03:02,355
From the Police Source

19
00:03:02,355 --> 00:03:04,355
Now I have received
this one copy!

20
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:07,315
Deepa...

21
00:03:07,815 --> 00:03:08,765
Call him for an interview...

22
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,725
Sir, I know that he is a Senior Journalist!

23
00:03:11,515 --> 00:03:12,685
But, in this book...

24
00:03:12,685 --> 00:03:14,565
I am unable to see a single truth!

25
00:03:15,105 --> 00:03:16,815
I have an interview to take in Delhi...

26
00:03:16,815 --> 00:03:18,225
And I am getting late for the flight!

27
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,015
If the Government itself, in banning and seizing this book

28
00:03:21,065 --> 00:03:22,515
has shown interest means

29
00:03:22,515 --> 00:03:23,935
there must be some truth in it, is it not?

30
00:03:26,975 --> 00:03:29,315
I may be the owner of this TV Channel,

31
00:03:29,315 --> 00:03:30,765
But you are the face of it...

32
00:03:30,935 --> 00:03:32,475
And you have to take your own decision!

33
00:03:32,815 --> 00:03:34,765
But since 50 years

34
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:36,435
I have been observing Anand...

35
00:03:36,815 --> 00:03:38,605
To even write a single word,

36
00:03:38,725 --> 00:03:40,395
he thinks a hundred times...

37
00:03:40,645 --> 00:03:41,855
He has written a whole book!

38
00:03:45,395 --> 00:03:46,645
I will give you half an hour's time!

39
00:03:48,265 --> 00:03:50,605
After that, you can find someone else to do the job!

40
00:03:56,225 --> 00:03:57,015
Shyam...
- Sir...

41
00:03:57,015 --> 00:03:58,935
Arrange the Interview in the Archives room!

42
00:03:58,975 --> 00:04:00,145
Send everybody outside...
- Hello everybody

43
00:04:00,145 --> 00:04:01,645
Nobody should know about this...
- Please clear the room!

44
00:04:01,645 --> 00:04:02,065
Leave... Leave...

45
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:03,355
I don't want a live recording...

46
00:04:03,565 --> 00:04:04,105
All right sir!

47
00:04:18,395 --> 00:04:19,855
We are journalists,

48
00:04:20,815 --> 00:04:22,515
the smallest of things...

49
00:04:22,515 --> 00:04:24,105
We hook, find and pull out!

50
00:04:26,395 --> 00:04:27,935
In this book that you have written,

51
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,145
such a big thing...

52
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:33,685
It will give rise to a deluge of questions...

53
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:39,105
These things directly implicate big people...

54
00:04:42,645 --> 00:04:44,935
Thinking, I will become a big officer,
I came to Bangalore...

55
00:04:44,975 --> 00:04:47,225
Thought of staying here, doing some odd jobs...

56
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:49,145
these scoundrels trouble me in office...

57
00:04:49,225 --> 00:04:51,435
On one hand, without money I cannot go to back to my village...

58
00:04:51,475 --> 00:04:52,815
can't repay the loan, my father has taken!

59
00:04:52,815 --> 00:04:54,015
Come to eat sir, come to eat!

60
00:04:54,105 --> 00:04:54,855
Hey! Get lost!

61
00:04:55,145 --> 00:04:55,975
Goddess Yellamma of Soudathi!

62
00:04:56,265 --> 00:04:58,605
Give this poor man a little courage and protect him!

63
00:04:58,685 --> 00:04:59,605
Madam, for rape,

64
00:04:59,685 --> 00:05:01,065
only men are to blame...

65
00:05:01,065 --> 00:05:02,065
Shut up Mr. Nagaraj...

66
00:05:02,065 --> 00:05:03,685
I have had enough nonsense for today!

67
00:05:03,685 --> 00:05:05,685
Oh God! What's this! This woman is behaving like Goddess Durga!
- We are going to take a short break!

68
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:07,685
To Deepa madam, in the Archives room,

69
00:05:07,685 --> 00:05:08,515
who will serve tea man?

70
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,815
It's based on a true story... You have written!

71
00:05:16,935 --> 00:05:18,605
For this imagination of yours, what records do have?

72
00:05:19,225 --> 00:05:20,685
Will people read all this?

73
00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:22,065
Will they believe all this?

74
00:05:23,935 --> 00:05:24,975
Give me that book!

75
00:05:42,435 --> 00:05:43,355
Now, will they read it?

76
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:45,975
Do you know what El Dorado means?

77
00:05:46,645 --> 00:05:48,185
You Mean - The Lost City of Gold?

78
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:50,645
Since thousands of years,

79
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,605
knowing that there is a Golden Kingdom, many kings...

80
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:55,015
In a mad bid to seek that,

81
00:05:55,015 --> 00:05:56,895
have lost many armies!

82
00:05:56,895 --> 00:05:58,435
Not a single soul was able to salvage it!

83
00:05:58,815 --> 00:06:00,015
If anyone had got it,

84
00:06:00,015 --> 00:06:02,015
he would have become the greatest king of them all!

85
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:02,895
Isn't that so?

86
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:04,395
Possibly...

87
00:06:04,895 --> 00:06:06,815
I have written this book about someone like that!

88
00:06:08,475 --> 00:06:08,895
But...

89
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,895
This is not an imagination,

90
00:06:10,015 --> 00:06:11,355
to show that it is real,

91
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,395
in this world there is only one record!

92
00:06:15,015 --> 00:06:16,265
What is buried in the sands...

93
00:06:16,855 --> 00:06:17,685
The Symbolic Heroic Stone!

94
00:06:19,065 --> 00:06:19,725
Symbolic Heroic Stone??

95
00:06:20,395 --> 00:06:22,605
To wash clothes, the stone that is next to the pond,

96
00:06:22,605 --> 00:06:23,315
Not that stone!

97
00:06:24,145 --> 00:06:25,105
In the stone,

98
00:06:25,105 --> 00:06:26,815
if his picture has been etched,

99
00:06:27,645 --> 00:06:29,315
then he must have achieved something big!

100
00:06:34,105 --> 00:06:35,065
That Symbolic Heroic Stone of yours

101
00:06:35,065 --> 00:06:36,105
however deep it may be buried,

102
00:06:36,895 --> 00:06:38,315
I want to see it!

103
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:40,395
I want to see it...

104
00:06:41,225 --> 00:06:42,105
The stone...

105
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:43,265
If it exists!

106
00:06:43,645 --> 00:06:45,105
Get an excavation team ready!

107
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:45,975
Let it cost any amount!

108
00:06:46,225 --> 00:06:46,975
Let's dig it out...

109
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:48,975
Where shall we send them sir?

110
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:50,815
Where is your Symbolic Heroic Stone??

111
00:06:54,395 --> 00:06:55,065
Where is it?

112
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:55,975
Your...

113
00:06:56,605 --> 00:06:57,895
El Dorado!

114
00:07:23,395 --> 00:07:25,265
18km away from KGF town you will get Baagnur...

115
00:07:25,265 --> 00:07:26,265
From there, on the Baindoor road,

116
00:07:26,265 --> 00:07:27,225
after 12 Km if you take left,

117
00:07:27,225 --> 00:07:28,515
after 4 Km you will get a hill on the left...

118
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,645
Near that hill, there is a Desert Palm tree...

119
00:07:30,645 --> 00:07:32,685
surrounding the tree, within 35 feet if you did,

120
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:33,725
you will find the Symbolic Heroic Stone...
Is what he has said sir!

121
00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:35,765
Arrange a team,

122
00:07:35,765 --> 00:07:36,725
leave today itself

123
00:07:36,725 --> 00:07:37,765
dig that and take it out...

124
00:07:37,765 --> 00:07:38,605
Sir, are you serious?

125
00:07:39,065 --> 00:07:40,355
In 3 days, it's my wedding sir!

126
00:07:40,605 --> 00:07:42,185
Just because the old man inside told, can we set off?

127
00:07:42,515 --> 00:07:44,265
The man inside is Anand Ingaligi...

128
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:46,315
So I am damn serious!

129
00:07:47,145 --> 00:07:47,515
Sir...

130
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:51,645
From 1950 to 1980,

131
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:52,855
All the papers are here...

132
00:07:53,355 --> 00:07:55,185
A good many more papers, I have asked for,

133
00:07:55,515 --> 00:07:57,435
but in all these papers, about KGF,

134
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,645
there is not a single article!

135
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:00,685
That's fine, leave these papers...

136
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:02,815
Leave this book!

137
00:08:04,435 --> 00:08:05,515
Let's hear it from you!

138
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,355
From your mouth, let's hear it...

139
00:08:07,725 --> 00:08:08,515
Who is that person?

140
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,395
Was he a hero...

141
00:08:10,395 --> 00:08:11,265
Or was he a villain??

142
00:08:13,895 --> 00:08:15,105
What happened in that place?

143
00:08:19,815 --> 00:08:22,815
The gold found in KGF has enormous value!

144
00:08:23,855 --> 00:08:26,105
But behind the hands that took it out,

145
00:08:26,515 --> 00:08:27,725
There lies a huge history!

146
00:08:33,225 --> 00:08:35,395
In the world, wherever gold is found,

147
00:08:35,685 --> 00:08:36,815
it's found by chance!

148
00:08:40,475 --> 00:08:42,265
In 1951

149
00:08:42,265 --> 00:08:45,265
at a distance of 18 Km from KGF,

150
00:08:45,515 --> 00:08:46,975
while farmers were digging a well,

151
00:08:46,975 --> 00:08:48,645
they found a strange stone...

152
00:08:49,265 --> 00:08:52,105
To investigate that, government officers came,

153
00:08:52,475 --> 00:08:54,225
with them Suryavardhan was present!

154
00:08:57,435 --> 00:08:58,265
Mother!

155
00:09:31,645 --> 00:09:33,015
It was destiny's act...

156
00:09:33,225 --> 00:09:34,065
That night

157
00:09:34,315 --> 00:09:36,015
two incidents occurred!

158
00:09:36,685 --> 00:09:38,145
That place was discovered...

159
00:09:39,975 --> 00:09:40,935
And he too was born!

160
00:09:45,105 --> 00:09:47,225
Like how stones and boulders are found,

161
00:09:47,225 --> 00:09:48,475
it's not that easy to find gold!

162
00:09:49,895 --> 00:09:51,435
But Suryavardhan...

163
00:09:51,435 --> 00:09:54,105
found all boulders to be infested with gold!

164
00:09:54,815 --> 00:09:58,225
He did not let even an atom of dust to fly away from there...

165
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:02,185
You have given birth to a son like an emperor...

166
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,145
My dear...

167
00:10:21,145 --> 00:10:22,765
He doesn't have a father man...

168
00:10:22,765 --> 00:10:24,645
The mother is suffering a lot!

169
00:10:24,645 --> 00:10:25,855
Do you want a father??

170
00:10:44,765 --> 00:10:46,265
Suryavardhan took that land

171
00:10:46,265 --> 00:10:48,105
for Limestone Mining

172
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,315
for 99 years on lease!

173
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:56,935
To safeguard the secret...

174
00:10:56,935 --> 00:10:59,605
He brought people by force

175
00:10:59,605 --> 00:11:00,895
And started Mining.

176
00:11:07,815 --> 00:11:08,855
Child...

177
00:11:08,855 --> 00:11:10,435
To save your mother's life...

178
00:11:10,435 --> 00:11:12,105
This much money is not sufficient my dear!

179
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:20,225
Marriage at 14...

180
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:22,265
A baby at 15...

181
00:11:22,565 --> 00:11:23,975
A life full of sorrows...

182
00:11:24,265 --> 00:11:25,355
At 25 years,

183
00:11:25,355 --> 00:11:27,145
death had came searching for her!

184
00:11:27,515 --> 00:11:29,565
But, to leave behind for her son...

185
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:31,315
She had only one asset!

186
00:11:32,105 --> 00:11:33,265
Her last words...

187
00:11:34,855 --> 00:11:36,725
Everyone thinks that if they money,

188
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:39,475
They can live a very peaceful life...

189
00:11:41,855 --> 00:11:42,765
But,

190
00:11:42,765 --> 00:11:46,355
without money, one can't even die peacefully...

191
00:11:47,645 --> 00:11:49,435
This no one thinks about!

192
00:11:54,185 --> 00:11:55,645
Give me your word...

193
00:11:58,895 --> 00:12:01,185
I don't know how you will survive,

194
00:12:02,185 --> 00:12:03,435
but when you die...

195
00:12:04,065 --> 00:12:05,765
You must be dominant

196
00:12:07,765 --> 00:12:10,145
As a immensely wealthy man...
You should die!

197
00:12:15,765 --> 00:12:17,935
I will become a very wealthy man, mama...

198
00:12:32,815 --> 00:12:34,435
She only showed him the goal,

199
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:36,815
But the path to reach it,

200
00:12:36,815 --> 00:12:38,475
he had to choose it himself!

201
00:12:41,475 --> 00:12:42,765
Give me money! Money! Money!

202
00:12:43,145 --> 00:12:44,185
I don't have...

203
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,105
You don't have money?

204
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,015
Here take money...

205
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,435
Hey...

206
00:12:51,565 --> 00:12:52,685
This is not enough for me...

207
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:53,725
I need more!

208
00:12:54,015 --> 00:12:55,145
Not enough?

209
00:12:56,315 --> 00:12:58,265
For trifles, you must beg...

210
00:12:58,435 --> 00:13:00,475
For more, you have to thrash!

211
00:13:07,895 --> 00:13:08,765
Power...

212
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:11,185
It's only if you have power,
will you have money...

213
00:13:11,975 --> 00:13:12,765
Power...

214
00:13:13,265 --> 00:13:14,145
Where will I find it??

215
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:21,395
For that dream,

216
00:13:21,605 --> 00:13:23,515
he reached the city of friction, Bombay!

217
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:25,225
Scoundrel, get up...

218
00:13:25,225 --> 00:13:26,105
This is my place!

219
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,315
Bombay, for the gold black market...

220
00:13:30,355 --> 00:13:31,435
was the main place!

221
00:13:31,815 --> 00:13:33,185
For this region,

222
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,395
two 2 gold smugglers...

223
00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:37,265
Dubai's Inayat Khaleel

224
00:13:38,105 --> 00:13:39,895
and Bombay's Shetty...

225
00:13:39,895 --> 00:13:41,975
Between them endless war was on!

226
00:13:43,105 --> 00:13:45,395
In this war another person entered!

227
00:13:46,145 --> 00:13:48,265
Even though his slipper size was small,

228
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:50,765
That path where he laid his footsteps was big!

229
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:52,225
Go...

230
00:13:52,725 --> 00:13:53,395
Tell me your name!

231
00:13:53,515 --> 00:13:55,015
Raja Krishna Beria.

232
00:13:56,565 --> 00:13:59,435
In Bombay, if you do big tasks,
you will earn a big name!

233
00:13:59,435 --> 00:14:01,185
then even small names will be remembered...

234
00:14:03,105 --> 00:14:03,685
Go!

235
00:14:03,725 --> 00:14:09,185
Polish... Polish...

236
00:14:09,355 --> 00:14:10,185
Shetty...

237
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,475
Everyone salutes him!

238
00:14:12,975 --> 00:14:14,815
He is the king of Bombay!

239
00:14:16,435 --> 00:14:17,225
That bloody Shinde,

240
00:14:17,225 --> 00:14:18,475
is troubling Shetty brother a lot!

241
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:19,565
We have to crack his head!

242
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:20,935
Are you crazy?

243
00:14:21,145 --> 00:14:22,765
Who will dare hit an Inspector?

244
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,685
Will you hit him?

245
00:14:23,815 --> 00:14:25,145
Will anyone in Bombay hit him?

246
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:27,015
Or will these kids hit him?

247
00:14:27,265 --> 00:14:29,105
Will any of you hit the inspector, kids?

248
00:14:29,355 --> 00:14:30,185
Is anybody like that here?

249
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:46,185
I found a man! Bugger!

250
00:14:46,725 --> 00:14:48,355
Hey! Aslam Boss said it in jest

251
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:50,105
and you have seriously come to hit him!

252
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:51,475
Hey! Come man!

253
00:14:52,435 --> 00:14:55,605
Let anyone call me a savage...

254
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,065
Let them repeatedly call me thus...
- Hey... Child!

255
00:15:14,855 --> 00:15:15,645
What happened?

256
00:15:15,855 --> 00:15:16,645
Let's go... Come man!

257
00:15:17,105 --> 00:15:17,725
He...

258
00:15:17,935 --> 00:15:19,265
He doesn't know my name!

259
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:19,815
What??

260
00:15:22,815 --> 00:15:23,475
He...

261
00:15:24,185 --> 00:15:25,645
He doesn't know who I am!

262
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:28,935
Who is that boy?

263
00:15:28,935 --> 00:15:29,815
I want him!

264
00:15:39,225 --> 00:15:40,515
Not a boy...

265
00:15:40,515 --> 00:15:42,475
My name is Rocky,

266
00:15:44,185 --> 00:15:45,975
you will remember it, right?

267
00:15:47,605 --> 00:15:48,895
Rocky!

268
00:15:52,435 --> 00:15:54,015
Sir, he is my boy sir...

269
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:55,815
I had made him sit in Andheri!

270
00:15:56,015 --> 00:15:57,765
In jest I asked him to hit the police...
But he!

271
00:15:57,765 --> 00:15:58,975
Don't worry about it man...

272
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:01,145
From the police, I have set him free!

273
00:16:05,895 --> 00:16:06,315
Hey!

274
00:16:06,435 --> 00:16:07,395
Where had you gone man?

275
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,765
Had gone to earn my name!

276
00:16:12,765 --> 00:16:14,185
Why did you hit the policemen?

277
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,105
If you hit someone,

278
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,725
the police will search for you!

279
00:16:19,975 --> 00:16:21,935
If you hit the police itself,

280
00:16:24,225 --> 00:16:26,185
A Don like you will search!

281
00:16:27,685 --> 00:16:28,435
Hey...

282
00:16:31,065 --> 00:16:32,765
What do you want??

283
00:16:35,265 --> 00:16:36,265
The world...

284
00:16:47,895 --> 00:16:50,185
In 1978,

285
00:16:50,185 --> 00:16:53,355
due to the crisis between Iran and Afghanistan,

286
00:16:53,355 --> 00:16:54,645
The enmity between United States

287
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:57,565
and Soviet Union had amplified!

288
00:16:58,355 --> 00:17:00,935
The outcome impacted the whole world!

289
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,725
Along with oil, coffee, steel and cotton prices...

290
00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:06,645
Gold prices touched the skies!

291
00:17:07,265 --> 00:17:09,265
By then, Suryavadhan

292
00:17:09,265 --> 00:17:11,855
had reached a stature that one one could touch!

293
00:17:11,855 --> 00:17:14,395
To firmly establish this empire,

294
00:17:14,395 --> 00:17:17,565
he had selected 5 partners as his 5 pillars!

295
00:17:17,815 --> 00:17:19,975
After Barghav departed, his son Kamal

296
00:17:19,975 --> 00:17:22,065
was taking the raw material that came from KGF,

297
00:17:22,065 --> 00:17:24,145
from that in the factory he was extracting gold!

298
00:17:24,815 --> 00:17:26,185
The gold that was extracted there

299
00:17:26,185 --> 00:17:29,645
would be brought to Bangalore
and the responsibility of distributing it everywhere

300
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,475
was overseen by Rajendra Desai.

301
00:17:32,435 --> 00:17:33,435
Andrews...

302
00:17:33,515 --> 00:17:35,605
The western region was in his control!

303
00:17:36,395 --> 00:17:37,395
Gurupandyan...

304
00:17:37,395 --> 00:17:39,265
The political strength that he had

305
00:17:39,265 --> 00:17:40,935
was supported by Suryavardhan

306
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:42,815
and entering national politics

307
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:45,355
He kept the government in his hands!

308
00:17:46,015 --> 00:17:48,355
Suryavardhan's biggest strength was

309
00:17:48,355 --> 00:17:50,105
his brother Adheera!

310
00:17:50,435 --> 00:17:53,105
With his shrewdness, for this fort that was built

311
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,815
Suryavardhan's son Garuda too became a part!

312
00:17:55,815 --> 00:17:57,645
Because of both of them, now KGF

313
00:17:57,645 --> 00:18:00,855
was so well protected that no one could point a finger at it!

314
00:18:01,395 --> 00:18:04,145
But one day he got a stroke and fell bedridden...

315
00:18:04,765 --> 00:18:08,975
Everyone working under Suryavardhan,
who was in the jaws of death,

316
00:18:08,975 --> 00:18:10,565
started desiring KGF!

317
00:18:10,685 --> 00:18:12,475
For the first time in KGF,

318
00:18:12,475 --> 00:18:14,265
shouts of mutiny were heard!

319
00:18:17,065 --> 00:18:18,605
Due to the rise in gold prices,

320
00:18:18,605 --> 00:18:20,975
greed had increased in Inayat Khaleel

321
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:24,065
He thought it to be the right time to enter Bombay!

322
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,265
With Shetty's competitor, Dilawar

323
00:18:27,265 --> 00:18:29,015
Inayath Khaleel joined hands with him

324
00:18:29,765 --> 00:18:31,395
and to Bombay's Nagpade port,

325
00:18:31,395 --> 00:18:32,815
He sent his gold.

326
00:18:33,895 --> 00:18:35,435
But before that came,

327
00:18:35,435 --> 00:18:38,015
Dilawar tried to take control of Bombay!

328
00:18:39,105 --> 00:18:40,265
It is Dilwar's order...

329
00:18:40,265 --> 00:18:41,815
We have to wipe off Shetty gang totally...

330
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:45,685
We must not leave anyone!

331
00:18:47,265 --> 00:18:49,225
Did you put our boys in the prison?

332
00:18:49,225 --> 00:18:51,475
Whose boys they are? Do you know that?

333
00:18:52,185 --> 00:18:54,015
1st time after Independence

334
00:18:54,015 --> 00:18:55,725
Bombay was on high alert

335
00:18:56,395 --> 00:18:59,265
Dilwar was just about to take control of Bombay,

336
00:18:59,265 --> 00:19:01,355
But he had a huge problem...

337
00:19:04,145 --> 00:19:05,225
Don... But Rocky?

338
00:19:05,225 --> 00:19:06,355
Stop Salim brother!

339
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:07,145
We have not found him yet,

340
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:08,475
Once we find him, we will let you know...

341
00:19:08,475 --> 00:19:09,145
You wait for now!

342
00:19:09,855 --> 00:19:10,515
Did you find him??

343
00:19:10,515 --> 00:19:11,645
We have not yet found him...

344
00:19:12,065 --> 00:19:13,395
Tell me... Tell me where is Rocky!

345
00:19:13,515 --> 00:19:15,225
But we have put all the rest in prison!

346
00:19:15,225 --> 00:19:16,225
What's the use...??

347
00:19:16,225 --> 00:19:17,475
First, catch him! Go...

348
00:19:17,475 --> 00:19:18,815
Search for him man!

349
00:19:18,815 --> 00:19:20,065
Search everywhere...

350
00:19:22,155 --> 00:19:22,565
What??

351
00:19:26,905 --> 00:19:28,065
They have caught Rocky Boss...

352
00:19:29,525 --> 00:19:30,695
We found him, come!

353
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:41,365
Kill him!

354
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,945
My father told me about him!

355
00:19:57,945 --> 00:19:58,655
My son...

356
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,775
Don't challenge the typhoon!

357
00:20:02,025 --> 00:20:03,365
Hey! Go man!

358
00:20:03,815 --> 00:20:05,065
Tell my father!

359
00:20:05,315 --> 00:20:06,405
Your son...

360
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,155
Has hung the typhoon itself!

361
00:20:08,405 --> 00:20:09,155
What is it Aslam?

362
00:20:09,155 --> 00:20:10,655
Your faces are so glum?

363
00:20:10,655 --> 00:20:11,695
Is anyone dead or what?

364
00:20:11,775 --> 00:20:12,565
Hey kiddo,

365
00:20:13,065 --> 00:20:13,945
go and get a Biryani Rice...

366
00:20:14,195 --> 00:20:15,365
Why are you looking at me like that?

367
00:20:15,695 --> 00:20:16,735
Go my boy!

368
00:20:16,865 --> 00:20:18,485
They have caught Rocky!

369
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:22,065
They have found Rocky...

370
00:20:22,065 --> 00:20:22,695
Get the stuff and come!

371
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,365
Hey...

372
00:20:24,365 --> 00:20:25,275
Come on...

373
00:20:25,445 --> 00:20:28,565
Inayath Khaleel's boats will reach our port...

374
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:31,235
Bombay will be lost to us!

375
00:20:40,525 --> 00:20:42,525
Today's my birthday...

376
00:20:42,735 --> 00:20:44,775
As a present,

377
00:20:44,905 --> 00:20:46,195
his heart...

378
00:20:46,775 --> 00:20:48,655
And his eyes, I want both!

379
00:20:49,065 --> 00:20:50,905
What all do all of you want, tell me!

380
00:20:50,905 --> 00:20:53,815
Kill him!

381
00:20:53,815 --> 00:20:54,695
Kiddo...

382
00:20:56,025 --> 00:20:56,815
Cancel the Kushka,

383
00:20:57,405 --> 00:20:58,155
bring a proper Biriyani,

384
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:00,365
With that get more onions...

385
00:21:00,655 --> 00:21:01,195
Now go...

386
00:21:02,815 --> 00:21:03,615
Kill him! Kill him!

387
00:21:03,735 --> 00:21:05,735
The smell of blood has made

388
00:21:05,735 --> 00:21:08,195
all the Piranha fish to come together!

389
00:21:08,445 --> 00:21:10,565
Since the past 15 years,
the work that you were not able to do,

390
00:21:10,565 --> 00:21:12,195
your son has accomplished it in a single day!

391
00:21:12,445 --> 00:21:14,315
But those fish did not know,

392
00:21:14,695 --> 00:21:15,615
that blood

393
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:18,155
was that of the shark that would hunt them!

394
00:21:18,775 --> 00:21:23,275
Happy Birthday To You...
- Kill him!

395
00:21:24,695 --> 00:21:28,735
Happy Birthday To You...

396
00:21:29,065 --> 00:21:29,985
Where is he??

397
00:21:30,195 --> 00:21:31,155
They have hung him...

398
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:35,695
Happy Birthday To You...
- Not him... Where is my son??

399
00:21:35,945 --> 00:21:36,655
Your son...

400
00:21:36,985 --> 00:21:38,195
He is in front of him!

401
00:21:38,445 --> 00:21:42,445
Happy Birthday To You...

402
00:21:43,025 --> 00:21:45,315
Happy Birthday...

403
00:21:45,315 --> 00:21:47,905
Hey! You don't hang the typhoon!

404
00:21:48,155 --> 00:21:49,155
What are you watching??

405
00:21:49,155 --> 00:21:49,985
Kill him!

406
00:21:52,655 --> 00:21:56,905
Happy Birthday To You...
- We run from the typhoon!

407
00:22:02,025 --> 00:22:05,815
'Bombay is mine' those who used to roam the roads saying so...

408
00:22:05,815 --> 00:22:07,485
He has brought them all together!

409
00:22:08,365 --> 00:22:10,695
All of them, in the very same roads...

410
00:22:11,865 --> 00:22:13,695
He will chase and kill them!

411
00:22:14,115 --> 00:22:17,365
My blood also seems to be red guys!

412
00:22:34,615 --> 00:22:37,695
When I was a kid itself, I came to Bombay!

413
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,195
It was like falling into a furnace!

414
00:22:40,905 --> 00:22:42,525
On these very roads...

415
00:22:42,735 --> 00:22:44,815
When I asked for two meals a day,
they hit me up...

416
00:22:44,815 --> 00:22:47,525
To sleep, when I asked for three feet of space...
They beat me!

417
00:22:48,615 --> 00:22:51,065
But Bombay did not know then...

418
00:22:51,405 --> 00:22:54,155
What was fallen in the furnace, was iron!

419
00:22:54,485 --> 00:22:56,365
Banging it several times

420
00:22:56,365 --> 00:22:57,735
and hitting it over and again

421
00:22:57,735 --> 00:22:59,905
it has now become a knife!

422
00:23:00,155 --> 00:23:02,025
A knife knows only one thing...

423
00:23:02,525 --> 00:23:04,115
Does Bombay belong to your father??

424
00:23:05,025 --> 00:23:06,275
No man...

425
00:23:06,275 --> 00:23:07,405
It's your father's!

426
00:23:07,695 --> 00:23:09,025
And your father...

427
00:23:10,275 --> 00:23:10,945
I am he!

428
00:23:11,025 --> 00:23:12,615
Kill...
Kill him!

429
00:23:50,485 --> 00:23:51,315
Kill him!

430
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:02,525
Why man?

431
00:24:04,655 --> 00:24:06,945
You are scared seeing how I hit them?

432
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,695
To them, I just said cheers and sipped!

433
00:24:09,695 --> 00:24:12,065
For you, I will have Bottoms-Up...

434
00:24:12,065 --> 00:24:13,525
and lick the pickle!

435
00:24:14,315 --> 00:24:14,865
Run!

436
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:17,655
Come on, come on man!

437
00:24:18,365 --> 00:24:19,025
Come! Come!

438
00:24:31,485 --> 00:24:32,235
Come on...

439
00:24:32,235 --> 00:24:33,065
Stop him man!

440
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,735
He is coming... Stop him man!

441
00:25:02,445 --> 00:25:03,115
He is coming...

442
00:25:04,615 --> 00:25:05,275
He is coming!

443
00:25:41,945 --> 00:25:42,695
He is coming...

444
00:26:00,235 --> 00:26:01,025
Brother!

445
00:26:01,695 --> 00:26:02,485
Brother!

446
00:26:06,905 --> 00:26:07,615
Hey...

447
00:26:07,865 --> 00:26:09,025
Where is the butcher's knife?

448
00:26:16,365 --> 00:26:19,235
If Bombay faces the ocean on one side!
- Hey... Stop! Stop! Stop!

449
00:26:19,405 --> 00:26:20,865
On the other side is Rocky!

450
00:26:23,195 --> 00:26:25,365
Even the waves, to come and touch the shore here...

451
00:26:25,405 --> 00:26:26,525
Go back... Go back...

452
00:26:26,525 --> 00:26:29,115
Go! Go! Go! Go back!
- They have to seek his permission!

453
00:26:38,275 --> 00:26:39,485
Turn it! Turn it! Turn it!

454
00:26:43,025 --> 00:26:44,735
Go! Go! Go!

455
00:26:54,115 --> 00:26:54,815
Tell me...

456
00:26:54,815 --> 00:26:57,275
The right guy to dig a pit for the elephant...
In Bombay we have found!

457
00:26:58,815 --> 00:26:59,405
Rocky!

458
00:27:08,775 --> 00:27:10,565
Inayath Khaleel's ship is going back Boss...

459
00:27:11,405 --> 00:27:12,195
What Boss?

460
00:27:14,985 --> 00:27:15,985
Was Bombay saved??

461
00:27:23,865 --> 00:27:25,315
An order to stop!

462
00:27:27,695 --> 00:27:29,315
Ruling over life!

463
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,565
Ruling over death!

464
00:27:43,525 --> 00:27:46,445
He is the life of Mumbai...

465
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:47,365
The very life man!

466
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:49,275
Don't dare stare at his eyes!

467
00:27:49,275 --> 00:27:51,235
Lightning will strike...
Run away!

468
00:27:51,275 --> 00:27:53,235
Fire and storm,
Whenever they unite!

469
00:27:53,235 --> 00:27:55,065
A dynamite like him is born!

470
00:27:55,155 --> 00:27:56,865
Oh! God!

471
00:27:56,865 --> 00:27:58,115
Look here!

472
00:27:58,735 --> 00:28:00,735
If he comes to rule,
He is the emperor!

473
00:28:00,735 --> 00:28:02,945
If you oppose him...
He is the very devil!

474
00:28:02,945 --> 00:28:04,565
Oh God!

475
00:28:04,565 --> 00:28:05,775
Please stop him!

476
00:28:06,865 --> 00:28:08,815
The hidden one is acquired!

477
00:28:08,815 --> 00:28:10,485
The one who revolts is captured!

478
00:28:10,485 --> 00:28:12,445
In the streets of Mumbai,

479
00:28:12,485 --> 00:28:14,525
With fright they will say 'Salute'!

480
00:28:16,155 --> 00:28:18,155
Salute Rocky Don!

481
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:19,815
Ra... Ra... Rocky!

482
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:22,065
Salute Rocky Don!

483
00:28:23,655 --> 00:28:25,525
Salute Rocky Don!

484
00:28:25,655 --> 00:28:27,655
Salute Rocky Don!

485
00:28:27,735 --> 00:28:29,735
This locality is yours Don!!

486
00:28:30,025 --> 00:28:32,025
You are everyone's boss!

487
00:28:32,735 --> 00:28:34,155
From Africa, the gold that was coming directly

488
00:28:34,865 --> 00:28:36,065
through the coast guards

489
00:28:36,065 --> 00:28:37,735
was getting unloaded at the Bombay port!

490
00:28:37,905 --> 00:28:39,525
From there under police security,

491
00:28:39,695 --> 00:28:41,025
in grey coloured marked truck,

492
00:28:41,445 --> 00:28:43,115
Rocky used to get the material...

493
00:28:43,525 --> 00:28:46,155
The sealed boxes, in his absence,
were never opened!

494
00:28:46,485 --> 00:28:48,615
He used to check it and to all other places...

495
00:28:48,735 --> 00:28:51,525
he himself distributed it, through the Goods Train!

496
00:28:53,405 --> 00:28:54,815
Without Rocky's orders,

497
00:28:54,815 --> 00:28:57,195
in Bombay, no decisions were being taken!

498
00:29:16,315 --> 00:29:18,275
The one who held your finger and made you walk...

499
00:29:18,275 --> 00:29:20,235
The one who taught you your first words...

500
00:29:20,235 --> 00:29:23,235
Her words are sacred!

501
00:29:31,865 --> 00:29:33,775
One who has grown with fire!

502
00:29:33,775 --> 00:29:35,775
Persistently moving ahead!

503
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:38,815
A warrior who has taken an oath!

504
00:29:49,235 --> 00:29:53,065
Where can you find an army to stop him?

505
00:29:53,115 --> 00:29:56,865
Is it possible to control a surging wave?

506
00:29:56,865 --> 00:29:58,775
He is filled with character!
His hand is like iron!

507
00:29:58,775 --> 00:30:00,865
He sells fear,
cares nothing for life!

508
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:02,525
Move away...

509
00:30:02,525 --> 00:30:03,775
There's danger!

510
00:30:04,945 --> 00:30:06,565
The hidden one is acquired!
- It can't be done!

511
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,565
The one who revolts is captured!

512
00:30:08,815 --> 00:30:10,735
In the streets of Mumbai,

513
00:30:10,735 --> 00:30:12,485
With fright they will say 'Salute'!

514
00:30:13,905 --> 00:30:14,525
What is it man??

515
00:30:14,525 --> 00:30:15,905
The clothes for wash, we had come to give brother...

516
00:30:16,195 --> 00:30:17,565
I too came for washing only!

517
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:18,195
Pour it!

518
00:30:19,945 --> 00:30:21,945
Salute Rocky Don!

519
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,615
Ra... Ra... Rocky!

520
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:25,865
Salute Rocky Don!

521
00:30:27,445 --> 00:30:29,315
Salute Rocky Don!

522
00:30:29,445 --> 00:30:31,445
Salute Rocky Don!

523
00:30:31,525 --> 00:30:33,525
This locality is yours Don!!

524
00:30:33,815 --> 00:30:35,815
You are everyone's boss!

525
00:30:36,615 --> 00:30:39,485
Henceforth Inayath Khaleel's men won't ever bother us...

526
00:30:39,735 --> 00:30:41,195
Everything is fine... Let it be!

527
00:30:42,275 --> 00:30:43,275
Because of Rocky!

528
00:30:45,445 --> 00:30:46,945
That shooter of yours...

529
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,525
Is accomplishing so much...

530
00:30:48,735 --> 00:30:51,065
Is it for Shetty
or is it for Bombay??

531
00:30:51,945 --> 00:30:53,655
We are all with you Shetty Don...

532
00:30:54,115 --> 00:30:55,905
But... It is beacuse Rocky is with us

533
00:30:55,905 --> 00:30:57,155
that we all are so bold!

534
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:00,235
Rocky's name, not only in Bombay

535
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:02,115
but in the entire South Coast...
It is being heard!

536
00:31:02,115 --> 00:31:03,865
Rocky brother,

537
00:31:14,445 --> 00:31:15,405
What Rocky brother??

538
00:31:15,405 --> 00:31:16,905
Today, how many people did you kill??

539
00:31:16,905 --> 00:31:17,565
After the day ends,

540
00:31:17,565 --> 00:31:19,525
I will count and tell you! You go!

541
00:31:24,025 --> 00:31:25,235
Greetings Don!
Greetings Don!

542
00:31:26,235 --> 00:31:26,525
Greetings Don!

543
00:31:26,655 --> 00:31:28,865
In Bombay, everybody salutes you...

544
00:31:32,485 --> 00:31:33,985
Other than Rocky...

545
00:31:34,615 --> 00:31:37,115
Rocky likes your chair a lot!

546
00:31:37,115 --> 00:31:39,365
If he feels he has the same right to it...

547
00:31:40,695 --> 00:31:41,655
Then it will become very difficult!

548
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:46,525
It's only till the nest is built...

549
00:31:47,065 --> 00:31:48,405
That the silk worm's life span extends!

550
00:31:49,655 --> 00:31:50,735
After that...

551
00:31:51,615 --> 00:31:52,905
They are just put in hot water!

552
00:32:03,525 --> 00:32:04,525
Hey Pathan!

553
00:32:04,525 --> 00:32:05,195
Yes Boss!

554
00:32:05,195 --> 00:32:06,565
In this Bombay city...

555
00:32:06,775 --> 00:32:09,315
Even if our address does not have a pincode,

556
00:32:09,315 --> 00:32:10,485
we get the post!

557
00:32:10,655 --> 00:32:11,815
Do you know why??

558
00:32:11,815 --> 00:32:14,155
That's because our name is so famous!

559
00:32:14,155 --> 00:32:14,985
Yes Boss!

560
00:32:15,195 --> 00:32:17,565
Can everybody become like you Boss?

561
00:32:17,695 --> 00:32:19,405
Some people hit ten people

562
00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:21,065
and think that they have become a 'Don'!

563
00:33:05,155 --> 00:33:06,195
Rocky!

564
00:33:23,565 --> 00:33:26,065
In Bangalore, you have to finish a task for me...

565
00:33:27,025 --> 00:33:28,275
If you do that...

566
00:33:28,485 --> 00:33:29,775
The whole of Bombay...

567
00:33:30,025 --> 00:33:30,985
Will be yours!

568
00:33:55,115 --> 00:33:56,365
The post arrives,

569
00:33:56,365 --> 00:33:58,235
not by looking at the address on the letter!

570
00:34:02,365 --> 00:34:04,365
It is due to the landmark that is on the address!

571
00:34:05,735 --> 00:34:07,905
For this landmark, forget the pincode...

572
00:34:10,695 --> 00:34:12,275
You won't even need a stamp!

573
00:34:14,065 --> 00:34:15,405
A golden bank...

574
00:34:16,025 --> 00:34:17,815
They are using to cash trifling coins!

575
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:30,275
Hey Pathan!

576
00:34:30,275 --> 00:34:30,775
Yes Boss!

577
00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:36,865
I am not someone who hit ten people and became a 'Don',

578
00:34:37,615 --> 00:34:40,985
All the ten people I hit were Dons!

579
00:34:42,735 --> 00:34:43,405
Yes Boss!

580
00:34:52,945 --> 00:34:54,405
Shetty saluting someone else...

581
00:34:54,405 --> 00:34:55,525
I saw it for the first time!

582
00:34:55,525 --> 00:34:57,905
Looks like he decides what happens in Bombay!

583
00:34:58,155 --> 00:34:59,315
That Shetty won't leave us,

584
00:34:59,315 --> 00:35:00,445
he will do something or the other to us...

585
00:35:00,445 --> 00:35:01,695
So what are we?
Are we wearing bangles or what??

586
00:35:01,695 --> 00:35:02,865
You shut up man!

587
00:35:03,405 --> 00:35:04,865
Don't you worry about Shetty!

588
00:35:05,115 --> 00:35:06,315
All the boys are with you...

589
00:35:06,695 --> 00:35:08,065
You used to ask always...

590
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:09,115
'I want Bombay'!

591
00:35:09,195 --> 00:35:10,195
Now the time has come!

592
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,065
Now you...

593
00:35:12,065 --> 00:35:13,615
You will be the King of Bombay!

594
00:35:17,065 --> 00:35:18,695
How deep is the ocean?

595
00:35:18,815 --> 00:35:19,275
What??

596
00:35:20,405 --> 00:35:22,695
Without knowing the depth,
you can't rule over it...

597
00:35:24,315 --> 00:35:26,115
Let's dive and find that out!

598
00:35:27,405 --> 00:35:29,525
To further my dreams of nearing El Dorado

599
00:35:29,525 --> 00:35:30,405
I got a twist...

600
00:35:31,775 --> 00:35:32,405
Bangalore!

601
00:35:42,155 --> 00:35:43,825
Stop the car near a bar!

602
00:35:44,165 --> 00:35:46,365
It's election time today sir...
The bar will not even be open!

603
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:51,695
Why are you running like this...

604
00:35:51,785 --> 00:35:52,405
What happened??

605
00:35:52,535 --> 00:35:53,995
Rajendra Desai's daughter sir!

606
00:35:54,075 --> 00:35:55,245
In some hotel...
Just because they didn't serve drinks,

607
00:35:55,245 --> 00:35:57,535
she has blocked the road...
And is partying right here sir!

608
00:35:57,535 --> 00:35:59,575
Everyone who is looking at her is being hit!

609
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:00,905
Don't go there sir... Come away sir...

610
00:36:00,905 --> 00:36:02,695
Help me... Help me!

611
00:36:02,695 --> 00:36:03,115
Sir...

612
00:36:03,945 --> 00:36:06,995
Sir help me!

613
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:08,445
The one who is coming...

614
00:36:08,655 --> 00:36:09,495
Is he a sharp shooter?

615
00:36:09,905 --> 00:36:10,405
No...

616
00:36:10,865 --> 00:36:12,785
I don't even know how his marksmanship is!

617
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:16,115
Then how did you trust him?

618
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:17,695
When a hit is ordered

619
00:36:17,995 --> 00:36:19,655
A lot of procedures are followed...

620
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:21,245
Sir, sir... Come sir!

621
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:22,405
Don't try to save him sir!

622
00:36:22,695 --> 00:36:24,035
They are not good people... Come away sir!

623
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:25,695
Eyes should not falter...

624
00:36:25,695 --> 00:36:26,865
The hand should not tremble...

625
00:36:27,035 --> 00:36:27,825
The breathe should be held...

626
00:36:27,825 --> 00:36:29,655
We should check the position we are standing in!

627
00:36:30,115 --> 00:36:31,365
In which direction the air flows...

628
00:36:31,365 --> 00:36:32,655
We should keep in mind!

629
00:36:34,655 --> 00:36:35,405
He...

630
00:36:35,575 --> 00:36:37,195
Will directly point on the forehead...

631
00:36:38,445 --> 00:36:39,405
And will pull the trigger...

632
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:41,695
Sharp shooters are meant...

633
00:36:41,695 --> 00:36:42,785
Only for the Olympics!

634
00:36:43,445 --> 00:36:45,405
It's a lot of risk that we are working in...

635
00:36:45,905 --> 00:36:47,075
Even if we don't,

636
00:36:47,075 --> 00:36:48,285
it's a huge risk, is it not?

637
00:37:03,945 --> 00:37:07,535
Smoke... Have a smoke!

638
00:37:08,825 --> 00:37:12,405
Let your sorrows be gone!

639
00:37:14,155 --> 00:37:17,195
Say throughout the day...

640
00:37:17,195 --> 00:37:24,035
Praise be to Lord Krishna!
Praise be to Lord Ram!

641
00:37:24,035 --> 00:37:24,995
Congratulations!

642
00:37:25,075 --> 00:37:26,285
Smoke... Have a smoke!
- Why??

643
00:37:26,325 --> 00:37:28,075
Smoke... Have a smoke!
- I love you!

644
00:37:32,695 --> 00:37:33,945
How dare you!

645
00:37:33,945 --> 00:37:35,195
How fair are you!

646
00:37:35,535 --> 00:37:36,535
What are you looking at?

647
00:37:36,535 --> 00:37:37,245
Come hit him guys...

648
00:37:49,785 --> 00:37:50,945
Where was I...

649
00:37:59,075 --> 00:38:01,075
I am already dead, my dear!

650
00:38:13,115 --> 00:38:14,785
Hey guys!
Go!! Go hit him...

651
00:38:41,615 --> 00:38:42,905
What happened guys?
You won't attack me?

652
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:43,905
Guys! Go!

653
00:39:02,995 --> 00:39:04,285
Hey guys! Go hit him!

654
00:39:09,075 --> 00:39:09,655
Now come on man...

655
00:39:18,035 --> 00:39:19,195
What are you looking at?? Go!!

656
00:39:44,405 --> 00:39:46,155
You damn rogue...

657
00:39:46,155 --> 00:39:48,115
You are wasting liquor!
You are wasting liquor!

658
00:39:54,155 --> 00:39:57,575
Do you know the value of liquor?!

659
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:00,495
Only drunkards know the value of liquor!

660
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:14,365
Looks like you have come
for the first time to Bangalore!

661
00:40:14,615 --> 00:40:16,495
You still don't know about me...

662
00:40:16,785 --> 00:40:18,745
After getting to know, don't run and hide!

663
00:40:19,075 --> 00:40:20,695
My father will find you wherever you are

664
00:40:20,695 --> 00:40:23,155
and drag you to this very road and hit you up!

665
00:40:23,365 --> 00:40:26,405
We don't have a habit of running away

666
00:40:26,405 --> 00:40:28,195
but we do have a habit of chasing!

667
00:40:28,785 --> 00:40:30,535
In my journey

668
00:40:30,535 --> 00:40:32,615
I have seen a good lot of smart guys...

669
00:40:33,075 --> 00:40:33,785
But...

670
00:40:34,825 --> 00:40:36,325
A lady who kills...

671
00:40:36,945 --> 00:40:38,245
I am seeing for first time!

672
00:40:39,245 --> 00:40:42,115
I have deeply falling in love with you...

673
00:40:42,785 --> 00:40:43,615
Shut up! Rocky!

674
00:40:43,655 --> 00:40:44,995
Shut up!

675
00:40:45,615 --> 00:40:46,615
Who did you say your father was?

676
00:40:47,035 --> 00:40:48,285
Rajendra Desai!

677
00:40:48,535 --> 00:40:51,445
He has taken care of you in a very rich way!

678
00:40:51,865 --> 00:40:53,745
I will take care of you in much better way!

679
00:40:53,865 --> 00:40:54,575
Don't worry!

680
00:40:54,655 --> 00:40:56,155
Leaving you, I will not go anywhere!

681
00:40:56,445 --> 00:40:58,245
I will come soon!

682
00:41:00,785 --> 00:41:02,445
Henceforth her father is my father-in-law

683
00:41:02,445 --> 00:41:03,945
and I am your brother-in-law!

684
00:41:03,945 --> 00:41:05,445
Your sister...

685
00:41:06,535 --> 00:41:07,995
Take good care of her!

686
00:41:08,825 --> 00:41:09,745
Do take good care of her!

687
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:21,445
This is the address you told sir...

688
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:22,695
Finish your work and go away sir!

689
00:41:22,695 --> 00:41:24,195
Once again don't come back to Bangalore sir!

690
00:41:42,865 --> 00:41:43,615
Kamal...

691
00:41:44,495 --> 00:41:45,445
What happened??

692
00:41:47,445 --> 00:41:49,195
Bangalore is very big... It seems!

693
00:41:50,695 --> 00:41:51,905
Searching for him is difficult... I believe!

694
00:41:55,945 --> 00:41:57,155
It must be someone new...

695
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,195
Single-handedly he has hit up all our boys!

696
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:01,495
Being drunk...

697
00:42:01,495 --> 00:42:02,745
With my Reena itself!

698
00:42:04,035 --> 00:42:06,745
Airport, railway station, bus-stand, highways...

699
00:42:06,745 --> 00:42:07,865
Everything should be shut down!

700
00:42:07,865 --> 00:42:08,785
That son of a gun!

701
00:42:08,785 --> 00:42:10,325
For no reason should be able to escape!

702
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,035
He would have taunted Reena...

703
00:42:16,035 --> 00:42:16,995
I know this!

704
00:42:17,195 --> 00:42:19,285
Don't bring him here again Daya...

705
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,365
Kamal! If your stars are not right...

706
00:42:22,035 --> 00:42:24,245
He will get caught by them somewhere!

707
00:42:36,445 --> 00:42:38,575
Do you know whose people you have hit and come?

708
00:42:38,745 --> 00:42:40,325
Do you know who that girl is??

709
00:42:40,865 --> 00:42:41,365
Who?

710
00:42:41,785 --> 00:42:43,195
Rajendra Desai's daughter

711
00:42:44,075 --> 00:42:44,615
Reena!

712
00:42:47,495 --> 00:42:49,245
I had returned without asking about her name!

713
00:42:49,615 --> 00:42:51,575
Reena...!

714
00:42:51,785 --> 00:42:53,615
What a sweet name!

715
00:42:53,615 --> 00:42:55,615
Why do you think we have called you here?!

716
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,155
Right from when I came

717
00:42:57,155 --> 00:42:59,445
we are dilly-dallying outside the garden!

718
00:43:00,535 --> 00:43:02,445
Shall we come into the story?

719
00:43:04,245 --> 00:43:05,495
What is the task, tell me sir!

720
00:43:09,325 --> 00:43:10,945
You have to kill a mammoth!

721
00:43:14,745 --> 00:43:16,155
What is our plan

722
00:43:16,195 --> 00:43:17,745
that will be explained to you by Daya!

723
00:43:18,575 --> 00:43:19,905
In a few days...

724
00:43:19,905 --> 00:43:20,995
A huge function is to occur!

725
00:43:21,695 --> 00:43:23,115
Before he reaches the function...

726
00:43:25,495 --> 00:43:26,785
On the road! He should be killed!

727
00:43:29,945 --> 00:43:31,575
To reach the place where that function is happening...

728
00:43:31,745 --> 00:43:32,695
There are only two roads!

729
00:43:32,995 --> 00:43:33,825
The way I see it,

730
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:36,445
He will enter from the main road only!

731
00:43:36,945 --> 00:43:37,615
It's a big road...

732
00:43:37,995 --> 00:43:39,035
Even people will be less there...

733
00:43:39,365 --> 00:43:40,495
There won't be any traffic congestion!

734
00:43:44,785 --> 00:43:45,655
Which is the other road?

735
00:43:46,325 --> 00:43:46,995
Those are small roads!

736
00:43:47,325 --> 00:43:48,615
Buildings all over,

737
00:43:48,615 --> 00:43:50,195
bus stop, market...

738
00:43:50,495 --> 00:43:51,695
No place to even move around!

739
00:43:52,035 --> 00:43:52,945
What I feel is...

740
00:43:53,325 --> 00:43:54,695
There is no chance of him taking that road!

741
00:43:56,195 --> 00:43:57,745
This function...
Where does it take place!

742
00:43:58,745 --> 00:44:00,155
In the DYSS new party office!

743
00:44:03,745 --> 00:44:04,285
MLA's,

744
00:44:04,285 --> 00:44:04,825
MP's,

745
00:44:04,825 --> 00:44:05,945
High Court Judges

746
00:44:05,945 --> 00:44:06,785
and Central Ministers

747
00:44:06,785 --> 00:44:07,825
everyone will be there!

748
00:44:07,825 --> 00:44:09,285
The security is now in the hands of the centre!

749
00:44:09,495 --> 00:44:10,695
The Chief Minister's name... Will be announced!

750
00:44:10,695 --> 00:44:11,115
Hey...

751
00:44:11,535 --> 00:44:12,695
Bring the lime man!

752
00:44:13,535 --> 00:44:15,325
The Chief Minister's name...
Will be announced!

753
00:44:15,655 --> 00:44:17,245
There... Touching him is also impossible!

754
00:44:21,445 --> 00:44:22,535
The one who is coming...
Do you have his photo!

755
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,195
His photo is not needed!

756
00:44:27,075 --> 00:44:29,195
If he comes the whole of Bangalore will come to know!

757
00:44:36,615 --> 00:44:37,365
Reena!

758
00:44:37,365 --> 00:44:38,785
He will surely be caught!

759
00:44:38,865 --> 00:44:40,075
After we catch him!

760
00:44:42,285 --> 00:44:43,785
Henceforth you are my responsibility

761
00:44:43,785 --> 00:44:45,035
I will take good care of you...

762
00:44:45,035 --> 00:44:46,075
You have told this to my father... Right!

763
00:44:47,155 --> 00:44:48,365
Your are taking very good care of me!

764
00:44:48,365 --> 00:44:49,075
Kamal!

765
00:45:01,825 --> 00:45:02,445
Who are you??

766
00:45:06,785 --> 00:45:08,865
He has taken this very lightly sir! Andrews Sir..

767
00:45:10,245 --> 00:45:11,035
What is happening here??

768
00:45:11,035 --> 00:45:12,655
Who is going to come here??
He still has not realised...

769
00:45:12,655 --> 00:45:14,035
What is happening here??

770
00:45:14,865 --> 00:45:16,865
Who is coming here...
If he was aware!

771
00:45:17,745 --> 00:45:19,535
In this universe...
No one would have come!

772
00:45:21,495 --> 00:45:23,245
Let him do his work...

773
00:45:23,245 --> 00:45:25,405
Just keep him far away from Kamal, that's all!

774
00:45:29,195 --> 00:45:29,945
Two days ago,

775
00:45:29,945 --> 00:45:32,075
forty five boys have come to write an exam

776
00:45:32,075 --> 00:45:33,155
and are staying in Bell Hotel!

777
00:45:33,155 --> 00:45:35,405
Matching his personality
A lot of people are there, it seems...

778
00:45:35,655 --> 00:45:37,405
Since all the boys are in the hospital,

779
00:45:37,615 --> 00:45:39,075
there is no one to identify him!

780
00:45:41,495 --> 00:45:42,245
There is one person!

781
00:45:48,695 --> 00:45:50,035
Don't leave anybody out of the hotel,

782
00:45:50,035 --> 00:45:51,155
Every room should be checked!

783
00:45:52,615 --> 00:45:53,325
Get that door opened!

784
00:45:53,995 --> 00:45:54,445
What do you want??

785
00:45:54,445 --> 00:45:55,155
What's the matter??
- No

786
00:45:57,035 --> 00:45:57,655
Get that opened...

787
00:45:58,285 --> 00:45:58,825
No!

788
00:45:59,535 --> 00:46:00,155
No!

789
00:46:00,745 --> 00:46:01,155
Madam...

790
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:01,825
Is it him?

791
00:46:02,195 --> 00:46:02,615
No!

792
00:46:02,615 --> 00:46:03,155
What about him??

793
00:46:05,115 --> 00:46:05,745
No!

794
00:46:09,785 --> 00:46:10,865
Hey! Who are you??

795
00:46:11,075 --> 00:46:11,535
Hey! Who are you??

796
00:46:11,655 --> 00:46:12,535
Who have you come from??

797
00:46:12,615 --> 00:46:14,155
What work do you have??
Tell me!

798
00:46:19,865 --> 00:46:20,695
You...

799
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:21,495
Came...

800
00:46:21,495 --> 00:46:22,615
To see me...

801
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:24,695
Even you weren't able to be away from me darling!

802
00:46:24,825 --> 00:46:26,405
There is no chance you will believe this!

803
00:46:26,495 --> 00:46:28,695
Just now I was thinking of you...
In the bathroom...

804
00:46:28,695 --> 00:46:29,575
I was having a bath!

805
00:46:29,785 --> 00:46:31,285
I'm going to kill you!

806
00:46:31,825 --> 00:46:33,995
I am already dead, my dearest!

807
00:46:34,445 --> 00:46:36,155
Now I like you all the more!

808
00:46:36,155 --> 00:46:38,495
You block the road to have a drink...

809
00:46:38,995 --> 00:46:40,325
To hit me up you come with boys...

810
00:46:40,325 --> 00:46:41,945
To the place where I am!

811
00:46:42,155 --> 00:46:44,445
You even threaten my life!

812
00:46:44,445 --> 00:46:46,075
Hey! Open the door!

813
00:46:46,075 --> 00:46:47,695
Now you are right next to me darling!

814
00:46:47,945 --> 00:46:48,535
My darling!

815
00:46:48,535 --> 00:46:49,995
I am like an express train...

816
00:46:50,325 --> 00:46:52,035
You are like the track!

817
00:46:52,035 --> 00:46:53,495
Both of us together...

818
00:46:53,495 --> 00:46:55,655
Can Chug along... Chug along!
Chug along!

819
00:46:55,655 --> 00:46:56,865
And keep going!

820
00:46:56,865 --> 00:46:57,655
Hey! Open the door!

821
00:46:57,655 --> 00:46:58,995
Hey! Who are you??

822
00:46:58,995 --> 00:47:00,035
Just a minute, my dear!

823
00:47:04,075 --> 00:47:05,655
When your sister and brother-in-law are in a room...

824
00:47:05,655 --> 00:47:06,655
They should not been disturbed!

825
00:47:06,655 --> 00:47:07,405
That much... Don't you guys know!

826
00:47:07,945 --> 00:47:08,655
What is it guys?!

827
00:47:09,075 --> 00:47:09,825
Hey!

828
00:47:09,825 --> 00:47:10,785
Hit him!

829
00:47:10,785 --> 00:47:11,785
Kill him! Hit him!

830
00:47:15,865 --> 00:47:16,785
Driver!

831
00:47:19,825 --> 00:47:21,365
Oh! God!

832
00:47:22,115 --> 00:47:23,195
Did you hit the driver too??

833
00:47:23,785 --> 00:47:25,325
Why do you get so upset about that, my dear!?

834
00:47:25,785 --> 00:47:26,655
I am here!

835
00:47:26,655 --> 00:47:27,695
Come, I will drop you!

836
00:47:28,035 --> 00:47:29,115
How is the Driver's attire looking on me dear?

837
00:47:29,115 --> 00:47:30,115
Are you impressed?

838
00:47:30,495 --> 00:47:31,825
I will also put on the Watchman's attire if you want!

839
00:47:31,945 --> 00:47:34,195
Even then, your driver has a lot of guts, my dear!

840
00:47:34,325 --> 00:47:35,155
Even after I hit so many people...

841
00:47:35,155 --> 00:47:36,155
Bravely he came in front of me!

842
00:47:36,575 --> 00:47:38,365
Henceforth like this...
Don't come out my dear!

843
00:47:38,365 --> 00:47:40,075
I understand the urgency...

844
00:47:40,075 --> 00:47:40,995
Let's get married soon!

845
00:47:41,195 --> 00:47:42,325
And after you get married!

846
00:47:42,325 --> 00:47:44,405
On the threshold I will not
make you kick the auspicious rice...

847
00:47:44,865 --> 00:47:46,115
I will keep a beer bottle there!

848
00:47:46,445 --> 00:47:47,825
You come and kick the bottle!

849
00:47:47,905 --> 00:47:48,995
Stop the car!

850
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:51,535
What happened my dear??

851
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,365
What happened??

852
00:47:52,365 --> 00:47:53,995
How dare you to talk to me like that...

853
00:47:54,155 --> 00:47:54,695
You idiot!

854
00:47:54,825 --> 00:47:56,495
You are not even worthy of standing in front of me!

855
00:47:56,655 --> 00:47:57,995
You have come and sat next to me!

856
00:47:58,325 --> 00:48:00,115
You are not aware of what my status is...

857
00:48:00,365 --> 00:48:02,695
A man like you... I will like??
How did you even imagine that?!

858
00:48:13,535 --> 00:48:16,035
After hitting four people you feel that you are a hero??

859
00:48:45,575 --> 00:48:46,495
You illiterate brute!

860
00:48:46,495 --> 00:48:47,325
One minute, my dear!

861
00:48:53,745 --> 00:48:54,655
What the hell man!

862
00:48:54,695 --> 00:48:55,695
Take out the car...

863
00:48:56,865 --> 00:48:57,905
Take out the Damn Car!

864
00:48:58,655 --> 00:48:59,405
Take it out... Man!

865
00:49:46,905 --> 00:49:50,245
If I polish eight boots then I would get a bun!

866
00:49:50,405 --> 00:49:52,615
The rice in a plate is spilt and eaten by such people...

867
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:53,785
In their midst,

868
00:49:53,785 --> 00:49:55,365
the bun that has fallen in the mud...

869
00:49:55,365 --> 00:49:56,905
If you are struggling so much for it...

870
00:49:56,905 --> 00:49:59,155
Your situation I can understand!

871
00:49:59,445 --> 00:50:01,995
Selfishness is making the world go around!

872
00:50:02,445 --> 00:50:04,155
It won't stop for anyone!

873
00:50:04,495 --> 00:50:06,575
We have to hold and stop it...

874
00:50:09,745 --> 00:50:11,495
Don't worry about them!

875
00:50:12,245 --> 00:50:14,365
None of them are as strong as you are,

876
00:50:15,785 --> 00:50:19,405
in this entire universe there is no soldier...
Better than a mother!

877
00:50:51,655 --> 00:50:53,245
Darling you were telling me something, my dear!

878
00:51:00,575 --> 00:51:01,615
Take me to your home!

879
00:51:02,945 --> 00:51:03,945
OK!

880
00:51:27,575 --> 00:51:28,575
Someone came in between...
See that!

881
00:51:28,575 --> 00:51:29,615
Clear that vehicle...

882
00:51:30,655 --> 00:51:31,695
Hey! Take the vehicle out!

883
00:52:06,445 --> 00:52:06,745
Sir...

884
00:52:07,365 --> 00:52:08,155
Greetings...

885
00:52:08,155 --> 00:52:09,115
My name is Anand Ingalgi...

886
00:52:09,405 --> 00:52:10,575
I had called you earlier...

887
00:52:10,575 --> 00:52:11,285
I am a journalist...

888
00:52:11,945 --> 00:52:13,905
Whatever I ask about him...
No one even dares to speak about sir...

889
00:52:13,905 --> 00:52:14,905
At least if you could...
- Come inside!

890
00:52:16,535 --> 00:52:17,655
You don't worry sir

891
00:52:17,655 --> 00:52:18,695
Your name will not be published in the paper!

892
00:52:19,995 --> 00:52:21,325
Put my name prominently

893
00:52:21,325 --> 00:52:22,155
Nagaraju...

894
00:52:22,155 --> 00:52:23,615
Son of Kalidas...

895
00:52:23,745 --> 00:52:24,245
Write it down!

896
00:52:25,325 --> 00:52:26,075
Now ask me...

897
00:52:26,405 --> 00:52:26,825
Sir...

898
00:52:27,075 --> 00:52:28,325
Before he became a Rowdy

899
00:52:28,575 --> 00:52:30,995
When he was in Bombay
He had a different name, I heard...

900
00:52:30,995 --> 00:52:32,655
Raja Krishna Beria

901
00:52:33,195 --> 00:52:34,405
How did it become Rocky sir...

902
00:52:34,905 --> 00:52:36,325
Day... mond!

903
00:52:36,535 --> 00:52:38,825
Since 1925

904
00:52:39,535 --> 00:52:40,155
What does that mean?

905
00:52:40,155 --> 00:52:41,995
It means... The year the Company was formed!

906
00:52:41,995 --> 00:52:43,035
Why do they put it thus?

907
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:44,575
For Brands... That is what they do!

908
00:52:45,575 --> 00:52:46,245
A Brand means?

909
00:52:46,575 --> 00:52:48,035
The name has a value...

910
00:52:48,285 --> 00:52:49,825
That all will know about!

911
00:52:50,245 --> 00:52:52,945
At a very young age, he decided to become a Brand...

912
00:52:53,155 --> 00:52:53,945
A Brand?

913
00:52:55,245 --> 00:52:56,695
I will tell you about an incident, listen...

914
00:52:57,905 --> 00:53:00,405
Sir, he has driven the vehicle rashly at 100 Km speed,

915
00:53:00,495 --> 00:53:01,905
he has even smashed the Check-post!

916
00:53:01,995 --> 00:53:02,865
Neither are the vehicle documents there,

917
00:53:02,865 --> 00:53:03,575
nor is the license...

918
00:53:03,825 --> 00:53:04,495
He has called someone...

919
00:53:04,495 --> 00:53:05,865
To bring the documents, I think!

920
00:53:06,075 --> 00:53:07,655
When you ask his name,
he is not saying that too!

921
00:53:09,115 --> 00:53:10,035
Do you have matches?

922
00:53:11,365 --> 00:53:13,155
In my Station, you are smoking in front of me?

923
00:53:13,155 --> 00:53:14,325
He screamed at thunder itself...

924
00:53:14,325 --> 00:53:15,575
Who cares for your riches!

925
00:53:15,745 --> 00:53:17,325
Whoever you might be,
yoou are first a slave of law!

926
00:53:17,325 --> 00:53:17,945
A slave!

927
00:53:18,155 --> 00:53:19,615
To even say your name,
you are acting smart!

928
00:53:19,745 --> 00:53:21,195
Speak up!

929
00:53:21,195 --> 00:53:22,155
He thundered once...

930
00:53:22,155 --> 00:53:23,655
I will set you right!
You rogue!

931
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:26,535
The whole Station shook!

932
00:53:47,745 --> 00:53:48,995
The Driving License...

933
00:53:53,445 --> 00:53:54,695
Hey... Give a chair!

934
00:53:55,285 --> 00:53:57,945
Where is it?!

935
00:53:59,495 --> 00:54:00,745
Found it!

936
00:54:01,615 --> 00:54:03,655
Even though many had not seen him,

937
00:54:03,655 --> 00:54:04,905
his name was known to all...

938
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:09,695
Rocky!

939
00:54:20,575 --> 00:54:21,405
Since...

940
00:54:21,905 --> 00:54:23,535
1951

941
00:54:25,035 --> 00:54:26,945
Sir...
He is such a big criminal brand...

942
00:54:26,945 --> 00:54:28,495
How do you accept that?

943
00:54:28,495 --> 00:54:30,445
I have put a golden ring to that hand of law...

944
00:54:30,865 --> 00:54:32,535
It will shake hands with me,

945
00:54:32,945 --> 00:54:34,495
and will salute me too!

946
00:54:34,655 --> 00:54:36,785
Police whistled and caught a Rowdy,

947
00:54:37,075 --> 00:54:39,995
but people whistled and cheered for him
and he became a king!

948
00:54:40,865 --> 00:54:41,995
After they accepted...

949
00:54:42,325 --> 00:54:43,905
Not a slave...

950
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:45,325
Who are we to deny it?

951
00:54:45,325 --> 00:54:46,825
The Chief!

952
00:54:49,995 --> 00:55:08,615
The King! The King!

953
00:55:08,615 --> 00:55:09,245
Sir...

954
00:55:10,285 --> 00:55:11,575
You have gone ahead in the story!

955
00:55:13,615 --> 00:55:14,445
How far ahead have I gone?

956
00:55:14,865 --> 00:55:16,155
Too far ahead...

957
00:55:30,195 --> 00:55:31,535
When did I ask for a coffee...

958
00:55:31,615 --> 00:55:32,495
Kindly excuse me madam!

959
00:55:39,075 --> 00:55:40,825
Rocky's curiosity was piqued!

960
00:55:41,575 --> 00:55:44,285
The marked trucks that were supposed to be in the Bombay Port,

961
00:55:44,285 --> 00:55:47,285
what were they doing in Bangalore under police protection??

962
00:55:47,865 --> 00:55:49,535
This inexplicable secret that he did not fathom!

963
00:55:49,535 --> 00:55:50,405
He went behind it!

964
00:56:17,865 --> 00:56:18,615
In Bombay,

965
00:56:18,615 --> 00:56:22,155
the boxes of gold could never have gone past Rocky.

966
00:56:22,905 --> 00:56:24,745
Rocky, who was only concerned with opening the seal,

967
00:56:25,155 --> 00:56:27,995
never bothered to think about the
hands that sealed the boxes.

968
00:56:29,115 --> 00:56:31,445
Seeing those boxes in this godown,

969
00:56:31,445 --> 00:56:32,945
one thing was confirmed to him!

970
00:56:32,945 --> 00:56:35,745
The gold was not coming from Africa!

971
00:56:36,285 --> 00:56:38,495
More than worrying about why this secrecy,

972
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:40,155
the only thing that remained in his head was,

973
00:56:40,745 --> 00:56:42,655
where was this Gold coming from

974
00:56:42,865 --> 00:56:45,365
and whose hands were behind this!!

975
00:56:48,785 --> 00:56:50,945
Breaking news! DYSS Party has...

976
00:56:50,945 --> 00:56:51,945
In the State elections

977
00:56:51,945 --> 00:56:53,905
In Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka

978
00:56:53,905 --> 00:56:55,905
For the fifth consecutive time, has recorded a win!

979
00:56:55,905 --> 00:56:59,115
Under the leadership of Gurupandiyan,
this party's flag that flew high

980
00:56:59,115 --> 00:57:01,155
shows no signs of coming down again!

981
00:57:04,535 --> 00:57:05,655
The Election Results have come in,

982
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:06,575
the time is too short...

983
00:57:06,575 --> 00:57:08,905
But only the CM's name is being
announced in this small function,

984
00:57:08,905 --> 00:57:11,365
will he take the risk and surely come to
Bangalore for this, what is the guarantee?

985
00:57:11,365 --> 00:57:14,405
To call him from there, there is just one idea,

986
00:57:14,405 --> 00:57:16,155
first we have to cater to his ego!

987
00:57:17,035 --> 00:57:17,655
How?

988
00:57:17,655 --> 00:57:19,655
Make a statue of his father!

989
00:57:19,655 --> 00:57:20,445
A statue?

990
00:57:20,445 --> 00:57:22,445
Placing it in front of the party office

991
00:57:22,445 --> 00:57:24,535
and announce that we are inaugurating it...

992
00:57:24,535 --> 00:57:25,785
He will come without fail!

993
00:57:25,785 --> 00:57:27,325
Till he is inside that fort,

994
00:57:27,325 --> 00:57:29,035
No one can touch him!

995
00:57:31,825 --> 00:57:33,405
Even then if he does venture out,

996
00:57:33,535 --> 00:57:35,445
It will not mean that has no army!

997
00:57:39,825 --> 00:57:40,695
Hey... Lay off!

998
00:57:40,695 --> 00:57:42,695
If Brother is not there,
you will keep fighting amongst yourselves!

999
00:57:44,785 --> 00:57:45,575
Vaanaram sir!

1000
00:57:45,575 --> 00:57:46,245
John,

1001
00:57:46,245 --> 00:57:48,495
the young master will surely go to Bangalore!

1002
00:57:48,495 --> 00:57:49,905
You too should leave for there!

1003
00:57:51,535 --> 00:57:52,535
Don't forget...

1004
00:57:52,615 --> 00:57:54,325
This will be our last chance!

1005
00:57:54,325 --> 00:57:55,825
Your Bombay shooter....

1006
00:57:56,115 --> 00:57:57,195
Is he ready?

1007
00:58:03,245 --> 00:58:04,495
Where is she?

1008
00:58:06,075 --> 00:58:07,325
Where is she?

1009
00:58:25,245 --> 00:58:27,745
Be cautious!

1010
00:58:27,745 --> 00:58:31,195
I'm a lightning like vine...

1011
00:58:31,195 --> 00:58:35,075
Eyes like the edge of a sword!

1012
00:58:35,075 --> 00:58:38,825
In the trap, it's when you fall...

1013
00:58:38,825 --> 00:58:41,945
Will you realize this plot!

1014
00:58:41,995 --> 00:58:44,245
Be cautious!

1015
00:58:44,245 --> 00:58:47,945
I'm a lightning like vine...

1016
00:58:47,945 --> 00:58:51,825
Eyes like the edge of a sword!

1017
00:58:51,825 --> 00:58:55,575
In the trap, it's when you fall...

1018
00:58:55,575 --> 00:58:58,695
Will you realize this plot!

1019
00:59:14,615 --> 00:59:17,155
When the slender waist gyrates,

1020
00:59:17,155 --> 00:59:18,945
When it swings!

1021
00:59:18,945 --> 00:59:21,695
You be ecstatic then!

1022
00:59:21,695 --> 00:59:24,325
The arrows of mischievous smile...

1023
00:59:24,325 --> 00:59:26,325
When they hit you, you clever one!

1024
00:59:26,325 --> 00:59:29,365
You will be my prisoner then!

1025
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:31,905
When the slender waist gyrates,

1026
00:59:31,905 --> 00:59:33,695
When it swings!

1027
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:36,445
You be ecstatic then!

1028
00:59:36,445 --> 00:59:39,075
The arrows of mischievous smile...

1029
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,075
When they hit you, you clever one!

1030
00:59:41,075 --> 00:59:44,115
You will be my prisoner then!

1031
00:59:44,115 --> 00:59:45,945
A beautiful wife,

1032
00:59:45,945 --> 00:59:48,035
Is like a honey bee sucking nectar!

1033
00:59:48,035 --> 00:59:48,575
But...

1034
00:59:48,575 --> 00:59:49,655
Later...

1035
00:59:49,655 --> 00:59:50,575
When you feel the intoxication...

1036
00:59:50,575 --> 00:59:51,575
It slows down, it slows down!

1037
00:59:51,575 --> 00:59:53,365
Be cautious!

1038
00:59:53,365 --> 00:59:57,075
I'm a lightning like vine...

1039
00:59:57,075 --> 01:00:00,945
Eyes like the edge of a sword!

1040
01:00:00,945 --> 01:00:04,615
In the trap, it's when you fall...

1041
01:00:04,615 --> 01:00:07,745
Will you realize this plot!

1042
01:00:17,075 --> 01:00:18,285
Rocky has come to the pub!

1043
01:00:18,285 --> 01:00:19,495
What is Rocky doing there?

1044
01:00:24,615 --> 01:00:26,245
The situation has gone beyond control!

1045
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,825
You have to come now!

1046
01:00:32,155 --> 01:00:34,655
What is it that you are searching for?

1047
01:00:34,655 --> 01:00:36,535
Look at my beauty...

1048
01:00:36,535 --> 01:00:39,325
A woman more beautiful than me, do you need?

1049
01:00:39,325 --> 01:00:42,075
Before taking a step,

1050
01:00:42,075 --> 01:00:43,865
Look at me once again...

1051
01:00:43,865 --> 01:00:46,745
Understand my signals, my darling!

1052
01:00:46,745 --> 01:00:49,245
What is it that you are searching for?

1053
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:51,115
Look at my beauty...

1054
01:00:51,115 --> 01:00:53,905
A woman more beautiful than me, do you need?

1055
01:00:53,905 --> 01:00:56,655
Before taking a step,

1056
01:00:56,655 --> 01:00:58,445
Look at me once again...

1057
01:00:58,445 --> 01:01:01,325
Understand my signals, my darling!

1058
01:01:01,535 --> 01:01:02,365
Alert...

1059
01:01:02,495 --> 01:01:03,405
Alert...

1060
01:01:03,575 --> 01:01:05,325
The lamp is extinguished... There is darkness!

1061
01:01:05,325 --> 01:01:06,995
In the trap of the vine...

1062
01:01:06,995 --> 01:01:09,075
Lets escape and run...
Slowly... Slowly!

1063
01:01:09,075 --> 01:01:11,075
Be cautious!

1064
01:01:11,075 --> 01:01:14,785
I'm a lightning like vine...

1065
01:01:14,785 --> 01:01:18,655
Eyes like the edge of a sword!

1066
01:01:18,655 --> 01:01:22,405
In the trap, it's when you fall...

1067
01:01:22,405 --> 01:01:25,535
Will you realize this plot!

1068
01:01:36,655 --> 01:01:37,325
This guy...

1069
01:01:37,745 --> 01:01:39,195
You gave such a build-up for this guy?

1070
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:41,245
By him...
You guys even got beaten up!

1071
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,995
I don't know where you came from!

1072
01:01:43,995 --> 01:01:45,035
After coming to Bangalore,

1073
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,495
where is Vidhana Soudha...

1074
01:01:46,495 --> 01:01:48,825
How is the weather here,
before finding out about these...

1075
01:01:49,115 --> 01:01:51,785
How bad I am, that you should have found out!

1076
01:01:52,195 --> 01:01:53,245
You made a mistake!

1077
01:01:54,495 --> 01:01:56,535
And now it's too late!

1078
01:02:04,995 --> 01:02:06,615
Don't waste a bullet!

1079
01:02:07,745 --> 01:02:09,035
He is not worth it!

1080
01:02:10,905 --> 01:02:13,155
Do you know why I called all of them?

1081
01:02:13,155 --> 01:02:14,575
Not to get you hit up!

1082
01:02:14,945 --> 01:02:17,195
To merely show you your worth!

1083
01:02:17,905 --> 01:02:19,075
To even aspire,

1084
01:02:19,075 --> 01:02:20,695
you need to be worthy!

1085
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:22,285
That too a girl like me...

1086
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:25,495
Still I will give you an opportunity!

1087
01:02:26,445 --> 01:02:27,905
To your manhood!

1088
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:31,825
In front of all of them,
if you come and touch me,

1089
01:02:32,535 --> 01:02:34,075
I will be yours!

1090
01:02:52,785 --> 01:02:53,535
Hey!

1091
01:02:53,535 --> 01:02:54,865
Go, go away man...

1092
01:02:54,865 --> 01:02:56,195
Get the hell out!

1093
01:02:56,195 --> 01:02:57,695
You need guts dude!

1094
01:02:57,695 --> 01:02:58,945
Get going! Get going!

1095
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:00,745
Hey kid!

1096
01:03:00,745 --> 01:03:02,365
Go to Balepet and tell my name!

1097
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:04,865
Two dozen bangles will be given to you,
in my uncle's shop!

1098
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:17,615
Do you have a match box!

1099
01:03:31,405 --> 01:03:32,245
Petrol...

1100
01:04:15,445 --> 01:04:18,035
Those who love are high on jealousy...
It is said so...

1101
01:04:19,785 --> 01:04:22,535
Everyone who puts his
finger on the trigger is not a shooter!

1102
01:04:22,535 --> 01:04:24,995
Everyone who lays his hand
on a girl is not a man!

1103
01:04:24,995 --> 01:04:27,285
What is my worth...

1104
01:04:27,285 --> 01:04:28,745
Other than those who love me,

1105
01:04:28,745 --> 01:04:30,195
it won't be understood by anyone else!

1106
01:04:36,745 --> 01:04:39,075
Hey... Where is that Balepete Bangle seller?

1107
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:40,655
In my uncle's shops

1108
01:04:40,655 --> 01:04:42,615
Without customers, the business had become dull,

1109
01:04:42,615 --> 01:04:44,245
That's why I was promoting it...

1110
01:04:44,495 --> 01:04:45,445
Sorry brother!

1111
01:04:46,195 --> 01:04:47,495
And then...

1112
01:04:47,495 --> 01:04:49,155
Who is that who said I need guts?

1113
01:04:50,785 --> 01:04:51,995
I love you darling!

1114
01:04:51,995 --> 01:04:53,495
You gave me a great idea!

1115
01:04:57,655 --> 01:04:59,745
He who plans to visit a city,

1116
01:04:59,745 --> 01:05:01,695
finds out about it!

1117
01:05:02,245 --> 01:05:04,285
He who comes to rule the city!

1118
01:05:04,945 --> 01:05:07,445
Informs the city about who he is!

1119
01:05:08,365 --> 01:05:10,945
If you think you are bad...

1120
01:05:10,945 --> 01:05:12,905
I am your Dad!

1121
01:05:12,905 --> 01:05:14,075
You...
- Kamal!

1122
01:05:22,745 --> 01:05:24,695
My father-in-law come!

1123
01:05:27,285 --> 01:05:28,745
Everybody out...

1124
01:05:35,115 --> 01:05:36,825
You got saved man!

1125
01:05:36,825 --> 01:05:39,035
They came, not to save me, you dumbo...

1126
01:05:39,035 --> 01:05:41,285
But to save you from me!

1127
01:05:44,695 --> 01:05:45,945
Who is he??

1128
01:05:47,905 --> 01:05:49,945
He is the one who has come to kill Garuda!

1129
01:05:51,325 --> 01:05:52,325
This chap?

1130
01:05:52,325 --> 01:05:53,785
Why were you called??

1131
01:05:53,785 --> 01:05:54,945
And what are you doing??

1132
01:05:54,945 --> 01:05:57,195
I don't want people who put my words in their ears!

1133
01:05:57,195 --> 01:05:58,905
I wanted those who will put it in their minds!

1134
01:05:58,905 --> 01:06:01,405
That why I came to Rajendra Desai's Pub

1135
01:06:01,405 --> 01:06:04,365
and made Rajendra Desai to come!

1136
01:06:05,445 --> 01:06:06,945
What have you planned?

1137
01:06:06,945 --> 01:06:09,115
Garuda will come only in the second road!

1138
01:06:09,695 --> 01:06:11,615
On the road where there are more people...

1139
01:06:12,445 --> 01:06:14,115
The newly opened shops,

1140
01:06:14,945 --> 01:06:16,745
The customers who move around there...

1141
01:06:17,995 --> 01:06:19,695
In the houses nearby the people

1142
01:06:19,695 --> 01:06:21,155
who have just taken places for rent...

1143
01:06:21,155 --> 01:06:23,365
Since many days,
the damaged vehicles which have been parked there!

1144
01:06:23,365 --> 01:06:24,535
The empty taxis...

1145
01:06:24,535 --> 01:06:26,615
Every single person out there are his own men!

1146
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:28,195
We can't kill him there!

1147
01:06:28,195 --> 01:06:28,905
Then??

1148
01:06:28,905 --> 01:06:31,695
I will kill him inside the DYSS Party Office itself!

1149
01:06:32,495 --> 01:06:33,365
What are you saying??

1150
01:06:33,365 --> 01:06:34,865
In that road there will be police...

1151
01:06:34,865 --> 01:06:36,245
Even in the gate there will be cops...

1152
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:38,575
Even Ministers will be checked there!

1153
01:06:40,245 --> 01:06:41,575
The young master is coming,

1154
01:06:41,575 --> 01:06:42,945
Everybody has to be checked!

1155
01:06:45,195 --> 01:06:46,575
You are planning to kill him inside??

1156
01:06:46,575 --> 01:06:48,115
We too will be checked!

1157
01:06:48,115 --> 01:06:49,615
He will also be checked...

1158
01:06:49,995 --> 01:06:52,785
Inside... If in my hands, I get a gun!

1159
01:06:56,195 --> 01:06:57,115
The gun...

1160
01:06:57,655 --> 01:06:58,575
You will surely get!

1161
01:07:07,115 --> 01:07:08,825
Having erected the statue and laid the bait!

1162
01:07:08,825 --> 01:07:10,745
They were waiting for Garuda!

1163
01:09:57,245 --> 01:10:00,655
My father has believed all of you a lot!

1164
01:10:01,655 --> 01:10:03,495
To maintain that, on his behalf...

1165
01:10:03,495 --> 01:10:04,865
I have come all the way here!

1166
01:10:13,615 --> 01:10:17,035
My father has built a huge kingdom itself!

1167
01:10:25,195 --> 01:10:29,785
I will build a kingdom much bigger than that!

1168
01:10:33,865 --> 01:10:36,615
The statue they had build was Suryavardhan's...

1169
01:10:36,615 --> 01:10:38,325
But what was installed there...

1170
01:10:38,325 --> 01:10:39,615
Was Garuda's!

1171
01:11:14,495 --> 01:11:15,655
Let's go... Let's go...

1172
01:11:17,615 --> 01:11:19,245
He didn't kill him?

1173
01:11:20,195 --> 01:11:22,115
Does that mean that your hero failed?

1174
01:11:22,575 --> 01:11:23,745
He lost!

1175
01:11:24,905 --> 01:11:26,325
Now what will your hero do??

1176
01:11:26,325 --> 01:11:27,445
Will he give up??

1177
01:11:28,245 --> 01:11:30,495
The wounded lion's breath...

1178
01:11:31,115 --> 01:11:33,365
Is far more terrifying than his roar!

1179
01:11:36,155 --> 01:11:37,245
What do you mean??

1180
01:11:37,325 --> 01:11:38,745
Page 128...

1181
01:11:39,285 --> 01:11:42,115
Taking a lot of trouble,
I have written a poem...

1182
01:11:42,945 --> 01:11:44,075
Have you locked the gate,

1183
01:11:44,535 --> 01:11:45,945
Have you called some security?

1184
01:11:45,945 --> 01:11:47,495
Don't allow anybody inside!

1185
01:11:47,495 --> 01:11:49,905
He won't kill that easily!

1186
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:52,615
He will shoot and hang him in front of Vidhana Soudha!

1187
01:11:54,405 --> 01:11:56,155
After a lot of thought, to get one gun inside,

1188
01:11:56,155 --> 01:11:57,075
If we struggled so much...

1189
01:11:57,155 --> 01:11:57,905
To protect,

1190
01:11:57,905 --> 01:11:59,285
A whole army was inundated out there!

1191
01:11:59,285 --> 01:12:01,785
In those, half the people who lifted their guns...

1192
01:12:01,785 --> 01:12:03,405
All these days, I thought they were our men!

1193
01:12:03,405 --> 01:12:04,615
Where is that guy from Bombay?

1194
01:12:04,615 --> 01:12:05,995
He is inside!

1195
01:12:07,695 --> 01:12:09,445
We thought if we kill him,

1196
01:12:11,115 --> 01:12:13,785
If we kill him when we thought that,
that place would become ours!

1197
01:12:14,575 --> 01:12:16,905
The heaven that we live in,
We have converted it into a graveyard!

1198
01:12:16,905 --> 01:12:18,945
Under the impression that we can rule some world!

1199
01:12:18,945 --> 01:12:20,365
The entire world!

1200
01:12:24,325 --> 01:12:25,285
But...

1201
01:12:26,245 --> 01:12:27,785
Why did he spare us?

1202
01:12:28,825 --> 01:12:30,035
Power...

1203
01:12:33,655 --> 01:12:36,115
He can kill us whenever he pleases!

1204
01:12:36,115 --> 01:12:39,945
But he had come to show the world what his power was!

1205
01:12:39,945 --> 01:12:43,035
Now he is waiting for his father to die!

1206
01:12:43,035 --> 01:12:44,995
There is very little time!

1207
01:12:44,995 --> 01:12:46,745
If Garuda does not die now,

1208
01:12:47,285 --> 01:12:49,245
we will all die for sure!

1209
01:12:50,825 --> 01:12:51,745
If so,

1210
01:12:53,405 --> 01:12:54,535
will you go there?

1211
01:12:55,825 --> 01:12:57,195
To that place?

1212
01:12:59,995 --> 01:13:01,285
In their midst?

1213
01:13:04,155 --> 01:13:05,745
Can someone dare to go to that hell?

1214
01:13:08,245 --> 01:13:09,995
Can you even think of that??

1215
01:13:09,995 --> 01:13:11,535
The blow that he has given us here,

1216
01:13:12,245 --> 01:13:14,785
No one will even think of going there!

1217
01:13:25,615 --> 01:13:26,785
The burning igneous chest...

1218
01:13:26,785 --> 01:13:28,195
Sweating in rampant fear!

1219
01:13:29,495 --> 01:13:32,075
Boiling meteors scattered in the sky!

1220
01:13:33,495 --> 01:13:36,615
The rest seems to have been burnt!

1221
01:13:36,615 --> 01:13:38,245
In a fight,

1222
01:13:38,245 --> 01:13:40,825
who hits first is not what is counted...

1223
01:13:44,285 --> 01:13:48,405
Who falls down first is what clinches the fight!

1224
01:13:51,575 --> 01:13:55,115
The one you have called me to kill...

1225
01:13:55,115 --> 01:13:57,695
Without killing him, I will not go back!

1226
01:13:59,495 --> 01:14:01,695
Wherever the place is,

1227
01:14:01,695 --> 01:14:02,745
However it is,

1228
01:14:02,745 --> 01:14:04,785
I will go right there and kill him!

1229
01:14:08,745 --> 01:14:11,945
The waves are waiting for the earth to embrace...

1230
01:14:16,695 --> 01:14:19,405
The sun waits with patience to set in the sky!

1231
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:26,945
Thunder and lightning are overriding the hillock!

1232
01:14:27,655 --> 01:14:29,495
To it's own writing...

1233
01:14:29,495 --> 01:14:30,365
Go man!

1234
01:14:31,575 --> 01:14:33,655
Fate too shivers!

1235
01:14:50,035 --> 01:14:51,235
Why all this for me, Mother?

1236
01:14:51,235 --> 01:14:52,535
I don't believe in God.

1237
01:14:53,115 --> 01:14:54,535
You believe me, don't you?

1238
01:15:03,735 --> 01:15:05,365
Don't ever lose this.

1239
01:15:23,615 --> 01:15:24,115
Hello...

1240
01:15:24,535 --> 01:15:25,785
Get a map ready.

1241
01:15:34,945 --> 01:15:36,035
The map you asked for.

1242
01:15:36,325 --> 01:15:38,695
Once you go there, our contact will be cut.

1243
01:15:38,695 --> 01:15:41,535
The map in your hand contains only half the information.

1244
01:15:41,535 --> 01:15:43,655
You will have to fill in the rest once you get there.

1245
01:15:44,035 --> 01:15:46,365
Once you get set there, give us a signal,

1246
01:15:47,535 --> 01:15:48,405
a big one...

1247
01:15:48,785 --> 01:15:50,655
There is only one way to get there.

1248
01:15:52,485 --> 01:15:54,485
John has sent trucks to a town...

1249
01:15:54,865 --> 01:15:57,155
to catch people like fish in a net.

1250
01:15:57,615 --> 01:15:59,445
You have to go and get inside one of those trucks.

1251
01:15:59,695 --> 01:16:03,695
But before that there are trained killers
surrounding the entire town with barricades...

1252
01:16:03,825 --> 01:16:05,735
You have to cross them.

1253
01:16:12,825 --> 01:16:13,365
Sir...

1254
01:16:13,825 --> 01:16:15,615
Did you find out anything about Rocky?

1255
01:16:15,615 --> 01:16:16,235
Hey!

1256
01:16:16,535 --> 01:16:18,695
Hey... Kiddo!
Bring hot tea for Shetty Boss.

1257
01:16:19,155 --> 01:16:19,695
Father,

1258
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:22,945
where has Rocky gone?

1259
01:16:26,865 --> 01:16:28,865
Since 25 years...

1260
01:16:28,865 --> 01:16:30,985
I have been working for him!

1261
01:16:30,985 --> 01:16:33,655
I don't know about him all that well...

1262
01:16:33,655 --> 01:16:36,405
Uncle... Will you say it or should I?

1263
01:16:36,405 --> 01:16:38,785
But theirs is a huge forest.

1264
01:16:41,365 --> 01:16:42,115
That guy,

1265
01:16:43,155 --> 01:16:44,195
her lover.

1266
01:16:44,195 --> 01:16:46,535
he will not return from the place he has gone to...

1267
01:16:46,985 --> 01:16:47,985
Will you tell her that?

1268
01:16:49,035 --> 01:16:50,235
Or should I?

1269
01:16:54,075 --> 01:16:57,235
Here, among the sheep...
Rocky was like a Ram...

1270
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:01,535
But in that forest,

1271
01:17:01,535 --> 01:17:03,325
he is just an insect!

1272
01:17:09,325 --> 01:17:11,575
Don't worry about him, Uncle...

1273
01:17:11,575 --> 01:17:12,535
He's gone!

1274
01:17:12,535 --> 01:17:14,035
He will never return!

1275
01:17:14,035 --> 01:17:15,325
Hey! No man...

1276
01:17:15,325 --> 01:17:16,985
I'm not worried about Rocky...

1277
01:17:17,655 --> 01:17:19,945
Day before yesterday, when he visited me,
he brought sweetmeats for the kids.

1278
01:17:19,945 --> 01:17:21,195
The kids loved it...

1279
01:17:21,195 --> 01:17:23,075
Just wanted to know where he bought that from!

1280
01:17:23,445 --> 01:17:25,075
Don't worry about him, man...

1281
01:17:25,365 --> 01:17:26,535
You know about him...

1282
01:17:27,115 --> 01:17:28,365
Don't you sir?

1283
01:17:31,365 --> 01:17:32,735
Hey... Sit down,
sit down all of you...

1284
01:17:33,785 --> 01:17:35,155
Hey... Fill them up in the trucks...

1285
01:17:40,695 --> 01:17:42,075
Someone is walking towards you...

1286
01:17:42,075 --> 01:17:43,075
Towards us?

1287
01:17:44,115 --> 01:17:44,985
Let him come...

1288
01:17:45,155 --> 01:17:46,575
He will not be allowed to leave...

1289
01:17:46,575 --> 01:17:47,735
He is not going out...

1290
01:17:47,735 --> 01:17:48,985
He is barging his way in...

1291
01:17:48,985 --> 01:17:49,615
What??

1292
01:17:50,285 --> 01:17:52,905
Once he catches the track, it's fixed!

1293
01:17:55,035 --> 01:17:57,405
Neither does he stop, nor does he bow down...

1294
01:18:10,905 --> 01:18:12,365
He is blessed...

1295
01:18:19,155 --> 01:18:21,575
Wonder who's son this adamant lad is...

1296
01:18:35,905 --> 01:18:37,825
Rocky is like fire...

1297
01:18:37,825 --> 01:18:39,195
Enemy...

1298
01:18:39,195 --> 01:18:40,035
Petrol...

1299
01:18:41,115 --> 01:18:43,195
As the number of enemies increase...

1300
01:18:44,035 --> 01:18:46,035
He burns brighter...

1301
01:20:09,155 --> 01:20:11,075
You mentioned that he had gone to some forest...

1302
01:20:11,075 --> 01:20:12,905
Please do not go there...

1303
01:20:18,655 --> 01:20:20,195
I promise on God...

1304
01:20:23,155 --> 01:20:25,035
The forest will catch fire...

1305
01:20:31,785 --> 01:20:33,155
Boss, the tea is cold...

1306
01:20:33,155 --> 01:20:36,075
Hey kiddo...
Bring a hot cup of tea for sir...

1307
01:20:36,075 --> 01:20:39,825
Today I have to give my kids Rasgulla...

1308
01:20:43,945 --> 01:20:44,405
Go inside...

1309
01:21:40,445 --> 01:21:41,325
Hey... What happened...

1310
01:21:41,575 --> 01:21:42,115
Who's it??

1311
01:21:44,445 --> 01:21:44,985
One guy...

1312
01:21:53,615 --> 01:21:55,285
They must have died fighting each other...

1313
01:22:11,195 --> 01:22:12,865
First send the trucks...

1314
01:22:13,445 --> 01:22:14,905
They are waiting...

1315
01:22:17,655 --> 01:22:18,655
He has left...

1316
01:22:23,735 --> 01:22:26,035
He did not know about the road he had taken...

1317
01:22:31,235 --> 01:22:33,405
He had no knowledge of his destination...

1318
01:22:39,325 --> 01:22:42,155
Nor did he know about the monstrous history...

1319
01:22:43,035 --> 01:22:46,785
Suryavardhan had grown to heights
where none could touch him

1320
01:22:47,195 --> 01:22:49,075
but a day after his fall...

1321
01:22:50,985 --> 01:22:53,575
The shouts of his heirs echoed.

1322
01:22:53,655 --> 01:22:55,695
You have built this kingdom with a lot of effort...

1323
01:22:55,785 --> 01:22:57,115
He had to select someone...

1324
01:22:57,115 --> 01:22:58,905
Tell... Who should rule after you...??

1325
01:22:59,115 --> 01:23:00,075
Your son Garuda...

1326
01:23:00,445 --> 01:23:01,325
Or brother Adheera...

1327
01:23:01,325 --> 01:23:02,825
Adheera...

1328
01:23:10,195 --> 01:23:10,825
Brother!

1329
01:23:11,195 --> 01:23:16,485
Here politics and deceit was stronger than a million swords...

1330
01:23:17,405 --> 01:23:19,985
You do not know either...

1331
01:23:21,155 --> 01:23:23,535
Like how,
without a desire for KGF,

1332
01:23:23,535 --> 01:23:25,365
you were standing behind me...

1333
01:23:25,825 --> 01:23:28,075
Like that you should stand next to Garuda...

1334
01:23:29,155 --> 01:23:29,985
Hey...

1335
01:23:31,865 --> 01:23:34,075
Once brother commands...
No more discussions!

1336
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:37,405
Till Garuda is around...
I will not desire this position...

1337
01:23:39,535 --> 01:23:40,735
That single decision,

1338
01:23:41,445 --> 01:23:44,195
shook the very foundation of the fortress built by him...

1339
01:23:47,235 --> 01:23:49,235
Adheera attacked Garuda...

1340
01:23:50,945 --> 01:23:51,865
He missed his target...

1341
01:23:54,075 --> 01:23:56,075
Garuda attacked Adheera...

1342
01:23:58,695 --> 01:24:00,115
He did not miss his mark...

1343
01:24:05,905 --> 01:24:08,075
Garuda took over the reign

1344
01:24:08,485 --> 01:24:10,865
and began to rule the entire KGF...

1345
01:24:14,865 --> 01:24:19,325
but he was well aware that
there were many people who desired KGF...

1346
01:24:19,535 --> 01:24:21,695
Although he knew he had enemies next to him...

1347
01:24:21,695 --> 01:24:27,155
He took an oath to wait till his father was alive
and then destroy his enemies...

1348
01:25:41,485 --> 01:25:43,945
To protect his empire,
Suryavardhan

1349
01:25:44,575 --> 01:25:47,485
had selected three forms of security.

1350
01:25:47,485 --> 01:25:49,195
One was a huge wall...

1351
01:25:53,235 --> 01:25:54,985
A huge door...

1352
01:26:02,575 --> 01:26:06,035
And to protect these two,
a ruthless Commander-in-Chief!

1353
01:26:08,285 --> 01:26:09,195
Vaanaram...

1354
01:26:17,985 --> 01:26:19,035
201 men,

1355
01:26:19,035 --> 01:26:20,075
15 women...

1356
01:26:20,075 --> 01:26:21,695
total 216 people...

1357
01:26:21,695 --> 01:26:21,985
Yes...

1358
01:26:23,035 --> 01:26:24,155
This years...

1359
01:26:25,195 --> 01:26:27,035
It is the 41st batch!

1360
01:26:28,155 --> 01:26:29,905
Put them to work...

1361
01:26:33,865 --> 01:26:36,535
After spilling a lot of blood Suryavardhan had built this fort,

1362
01:26:37,195 --> 01:26:38,195
he had only one worry!

1363
01:26:40,035 --> 01:26:44,285
That no one should enter this place
and spill a drop of his blood...

1364
01:26:47,865 --> 01:26:51,035
Suryavardhan called this place Naraachi...

1365
01:26:51,485 --> 01:26:52,785
Naraachi means

1366
01:26:52,785 --> 01:26:54,325
the Goldsmith's weighing scale on which,

1367
01:26:54,865 --> 01:26:57,155
he placed intelligence on one side

1368
01:26:57,445 --> 01:27:01,285
and fear on the other and equalized it!

1369
01:27:29,195 --> 01:27:31,155
The new dogs have arrived.

1370
01:27:31,155 --> 01:27:32,405
Take them...

1371
01:27:44,575 --> 01:27:46,655
Brother... When will they send us from here?

1372
01:27:46,655 --> 01:27:49,655
Since 20 years...
I have been asking the same question!

1373
01:28:01,035 --> 01:28:01,535
He has come...

1374
01:28:01,535 --> 01:28:03,235
He has come...
I told you... I told you...

1375
01:28:03,235 --> 01:28:05,195
He would rescue us all.
- You say the same thing about everyone who comes here...

1376
01:28:05,195 --> 01:28:07,075
He... He... Will save us.
- Get going... Get going

1377
01:28:12,445 --> 01:28:13,945
Who hit him??

1378
01:28:13,945 --> 01:28:14,985
I did brother...

1379
01:28:19,575 --> 01:28:22,155
Apply tincher on his wounds and give him some food...

1380
01:28:24,365 --> 01:28:26,445
He murders on the one hand

1381
01:28:26,445 --> 01:28:28,035
and on the other shows compassion...

1382
01:28:28,035 --> 01:28:29,615
I'm unable to understand my brother.

1383
01:28:29,615 --> 01:28:30,575
Compassion??

1384
01:28:30,575 --> 01:28:32,735
You have just returned from London.

1385
01:28:32,735 --> 01:28:34,735
You will understand more as time goes by...

1386
01:28:35,035 --> 01:28:36,735
He said that these three people have to be well taken care of,

1387
01:28:37,075 --> 01:28:38,405
they who had come to kill Garuda...

1388
01:28:38,735 --> 01:28:40,365
Do you know why he has kept them alive?

1389
01:28:40,905 --> 01:28:42,575
This time for the procession of the Goddess,

1390
01:28:42,575 --> 01:28:44,035
Rams have not been brought...

1391
01:28:44,235 --> 01:28:45,075
So?

1392
01:29:58,655 --> 01:29:59,985
You have all recently come here

1393
01:30:00,535 --> 01:30:03,325
but there is no time for anyone to wipe their tears...

1394
01:30:03,575 --> 01:30:05,535
You've learnt how to bow your heads down...

1395
01:30:06,115 --> 01:30:07,405
There is still a lot to learn...

1396
01:30:07,405 --> 01:30:09,075
You arrived yesterday?

1397
01:30:09,325 --> 01:30:10,985
You arrived yesterday?

1398
01:30:11,115 --> 01:30:12,735
Which movie was released?

1399
01:30:12,905 --> 01:30:14,785
Which movie was released?

1400
01:30:14,945 --> 01:30:16,235
Don't you know?

1401
01:30:16,485 --> 01:30:17,615
Don't you know?

1402
01:30:17,615 --> 01:30:18,655
Go away!

1403
01:30:18,905 --> 01:30:20,035
Go away!

1404
01:30:28,535 --> 01:30:30,075
We have been brought here

1405
01:30:34,075 --> 01:30:35,235
for mining...

1406
01:31:01,655 --> 01:31:04,535
Everyday we have to work in a 12 hour shift...

1407
01:31:05,575 --> 01:31:07,985
No one should raise their heads and look at the guards...

1408
01:31:10,985 --> 01:31:12,485
They do not tolerate being looked at...

1409
01:31:14,485 --> 01:31:15,615
They will shoot you...

1410
01:31:41,735 --> 01:31:44,325
You will work 900 feet below ground...

1411
01:31:51,485 --> 01:31:53,785
You will be a little scared on the first day...

1412
01:32:06,115 --> 01:32:07,865
Forget the outside world...

1413
01:32:21,945 --> 01:32:22,445
Come outside...

1414
01:32:23,615 --> 01:32:24,115
Come...

1415
01:32:27,865 --> 01:32:28,985
Blasting....

1416
01:32:41,535 --> 01:32:43,945
It's done, come for work!

1417
01:32:51,575 --> 01:32:54,075
Instead of working...

1418
01:32:54,075 --> 01:32:55,825
Hey... Hey... He's a newcomer...

1419
01:32:56,075 --> 01:32:56,695
A newcomer...

1420
01:32:56,905 --> 01:32:57,615
I will tell him...

1421
01:32:57,785 --> 01:32:58,865
Work, work!

1422
01:33:04,115 --> 01:33:06,695
Do you want to die on the first day of your job?

1423
01:33:07,285 --> 01:33:08,485
What were you doing?

1424
01:33:08,905 --> 01:33:10,535
What were you doing outside?

1425
01:33:12,735 --> 01:33:13,655
Construction work!

1426
01:33:14,535 --> 01:33:16,785
The wounds on the upper part of your palms tell me...

1427
01:33:17,155 --> 01:33:18,695
About the work you were doing outside...

1428
01:33:23,195 --> 01:33:25,945
The sooner you learn the ways and methods of this place,

1429
01:33:26,945 --> 01:33:27,945
the better it will be for you...

1430
01:33:35,155 --> 01:33:37,485
Sorry...

1431
01:33:50,205 --> 01:33:52,075
In the trucks that reached here day before yesterday,

1432
01:33:52,115 --> 01:33:53,995
Before Batch number 49 reaches here...

1433
01:33:53,995 --> 01:33:55,205
An incident happened in John's gang!

1434
01:33:56,365 --> 01:33:57,245
Ramana told me about it...

1435
01:33:57,535 --> 01:33:58,205
What happened?

1436
01:33:58,365 --> 01:33:59,955
Our boys always squabbled with each other...

1437
01:34:00,365 --> 01:34:01,905
But don't know what happened this time,

1438
01:34:02,155 --> 01:34:03,825
they have fought and killed each other!

1439
01:34:04,035 --> 01:34:05,615
Is no one alive amongst them?

1440
01:34:05,615 --> 01:34:07,325
Only one was alive when I came...

1441
01:34:07,655 --> 01:34:09,075
Did he say anything?

1442
01:34:09,075 --> 01:34:10,405
While breathing his last,
he said, 'One man...'

1443
01:34:10,705 --> 01:34:11,655
I did not understand anything!

1444
01:34:12,205 --> 01:34:13,245
One man?

1445
01:34:14,825 --> 01:34:15,455
Vanaram sir...

1446
01:34:16,115 --> 01:34:16,535
Sir!

1447
01:34:17,995 --> 01:34:19,115
One man!

1448
01:34:42,535 --> 01:34:44,405
We are playing a game of chess

1449
01:34:45,995 --> 01:34:48,035
But we seem to be playing with just a pawn!

1450
01:34:49,705 --> 01:34:50,995
We have guards at the gate...

1451
01:34:54,245 --> 01:34:55,655
We have guards at the Mining...

1452
01:34:58,865 --> 01:35:00,365
We have guards at the watch tower...

1453
01:35:03,495 --> 01:35:04,785
We have guards on the walls too!

1454
01:35:07,325 --> 01:35:08,655
Garuda's guards!

1455
01:35:12,905 --> 01:35:14,285
You don't worry!

1456
01:35:14,285 --> 01:35:16,365
We all have ample security!

1457
01:35:16,655 --> 01:35:19,615
Even if the security was very tight,
Rocky has to cross Biligiri

1458
01:35:19,615 --> 01:35:22,495
and enter the house through
a tunnel near one of the watch towers

1459
01:35:22,495 --> 01:35:23,705
And kill Garuda...

1460
01:35:24,075 --> 01:35:26,285
We have only given Rocky the blueprints of the house

1461
01:35:26,455 --> 01:35:30,115
But he has to find out under which Watch tower the tunnel is!

1462
01:35:31,115 --> 01:35:32,365
How will he find it?

1463
01:35:32,905 --> 01:35:33,955
Maintenance room...

1464
01:35:37,075 --> 01:35:39,655
All the information in Narachi will be got right there!

1465
01:35:40,575 --> 01:35:42,825
No one is permitted without scrutiny!

1466
01:35:42,825 --> 01:35:43,285
Hey...

1467
01:35:43,285 --> 01:35:44,285
Stand right there!

1468
01:35:46,155 --> 01:35:48,075
But the highest security is at that place!

1469
01:35:49,905 --> 01:35:50,825
Then how?

1470
01:35:53,995 --> 01:35:56,365
In a sea of blood there will be more bloodshed...

1471
01:35:56,365 --> 01:35:57,705
The blood of Ram's will flow...

1472
01:35:57,705 --> 01:36:00,405
People are saying that this time they will
sacrifice three men instead of Rams!

1473
01:36:00,405 --> 01:36:02,245
When electricity goes off here!

1474
01:36:02,245 --> 01:36:05,455
The guards coming rushing in... From everywhere!

1475
01:36:06,285 --> 01:36:07,535
I don't know how...

1476
01:36:07,535 --> 01:36:09,205
Even though all the guards have Walkies with them,

1477
01:36:09,205 --> 01:36:11,455
at times they will be suffering due to lack of signal!

1478
01:36:12,955 --> 01:36:15,615
Crossing many Mines Rocky had reached Narachi

1479
01:36:16,155 --> 01:36:18,575
and was trying to learn about it!

1480
01:36:22,115 --> 01:36:24,405
If 20,000 workers

1481
01:36:24,655 --> 01:36:27,495
were to be monitered by 400 guards,

1482
01:36:29,745 --> 01:36:32,245
the rules governing them had to be extreme!

1483
01:36:36,825 --> 01:36:39,245
Due to what happened that day,
Rocky...

1484
01:36:39,955 --> 01:36:42,155
became one among the people there!

1485
01:37:00,575 --> 01:37:01,995
Shankra...

1486
01:38:00,365 --> 01:38:02,285
Leave my place...

1487
01:38:02,285 --> 01:38:04,495
I will hold it...
Leave that to me...

1488
01:38:04,495 --> 01:38:07,115
Leave it!
This is my place...

1489
01:38:18,155 --> 01:38:21,495
The day after they find out that he is blind,

1490
01:38:21,955 --> 01:38:24,035
he will have to be buried!

1491
01:38:26,365 --> 01:38:29,115
Hey... Put the mud...

1492
01:38:29,115 --> 01:38:30,955
Put it... Put it,

1493
01:38:30,955 --> 01:38:33,705
Put it guys... Put it!

1494
01:38:34,825 --> 01:38:37,995
If they realise that you are unfit to work, that's it!

1495
01:38:44,115 --> 01:38:45,495
Rugga will enter!

1496
01:39:09,575 --> 01:39:11,535
He could not even shoot the guy next to him!

1497
01:39:35,155 --> 01:39:38,035
People put animals in cages,

1498
01:39:38,365 --> 01:39:42,245
but here animals have put people in cages...

1499
01:39:42,245 --> 01:39:44,745
Here there is neither heaven nor hell...

1500
01:39:44,955 --> 01:39:46,955
Nor is there good or bad...

1501
01:39:47,285 --> 01:39:48,865
No beliefs at all!

1502
01:39:50,285 --> 01:39:54,155
But Rugga was just a small replica of Garuda!

1503
01:39:55,075 --> 01:39:57,205
Don't get sucked in by emotions!

1504
01:39:57,205 --> 01:39:58,745
There is no value for them here!

1505
01:40:01,365 --> 01:40:03,745
That will not affect the stone-hearted!

1506
01:40:05,115 --> 01:40:06,495
I am just understanding the ways of the world here...

1507
01:40:07,575 --> 01:40:10,365
Only two people were standing firm in Narachi...

1508
01:40:14,365 --> 01:40:15,905
Those scoundrels will never be sensible,

1509
01:40:15,905 --> 01:40:18,325
They have klilled the mother and son,
just because they crossed Biligere!

1510
01:40:18,325 --> 01:40:20,705
Don't give any of them food today!

1511
01:40:21,285 --> 01:40:22,865
The rest of the people lives

1512
01:40:23,325 --> 01:40:24,405
seemed to be have been uprooted!

1513
01:40:24,955 --> 01:40:25,495
Hey...

1514
01:40:25,865 --> 01:40:26,785
Call Kencha....

1515
01:40:27,495 --> 01:40:28,405
let him tell a story,

1516
01:40:29,365 --> 01:40:31,205
the children will stop crying out of hunger!

1517
01:40:31,705 --> 01:40:33,865
But in a place where beliefs were dead,

1518
01:40:34,785 --> 01:40:35,825
a mad man...

1519
01:40:36,905 --> 01:40:38,955
was narrating stories that he had created...

1520
01:40:39,245 --> 01:40:41,825
Hey... You always repeat the same thing!

1521
01:40:41,825 --> 01:40:43,455
Tell us some story!

1522
01:40:43,455 --> 01:40:45,245
You have seen so many movies,

1523
01:40:45,245 --> 01:40:46,825
daily you tell us a different story...

1524
01:40:47,655 --> 01:40:49,955
Tell us a story!

1525
01:40:52,905 --> 01:40:54,245
I will tell you the story of that forest...

1526
01:40:55,535 --> 01:40:57,615
I will tell you the story of that hero!

1527
01:40:57,615 --> 01:40:59,245
The story of the hero!

1528
01:41:00,405 --> 01:41:02,905
In the direction of Modana under the hill

1529
01:41:02,905 --> 01:41:04,785
was a beautiful forest...

1530
01:41:05,245 --> 01:41:07,405
Soft hearted tribals lived

1531
01:41:07,405 --> 01:41:09,745
in the midst of lush Sandlewood!!

1532
01:41:09,745 --> 01:41:11,705
Hope you have a beautiful bonny boy baby!

1533
01:41:11,995 --> 01:41:12,615
Hey granny...

1534
01:41:12,615 --> 01:41:13,575
Why a baby boy?

1535
01:41:13,575 --> 01:41:14,575
I want a baby girl only!

1536
01:41:14,575 --> 01:41:15,535
Bless me again!

1537
01:41:15,535 --> 01:41:16,995
Fine... Fine...
May you have a girl baby!

1538
01:41:17,495 --> 01:41:19,955
A rain of fire fell in the forest!

1539
01:41:23,115 --> 01:41:25,365
The blaze of thunder...
Wherever you see!

1540
01:41:27,365 --> 01:41:28,405
Which shift have they given you?

1541
01:41:28,405 --> 01:41:29,115
Night shift!

1542
01:41:30,245 --> 01:41:31,455
They have given me the morning shift!

1543
01:41:31,455 --> 01:41:32,535
Wait, I will ask them and come!

1544
01:41:32,535 --> 01:41:33,495
No, don't go!

1545
01:41:33,495 --> 01:41:34,865
Don't know what they will do...

1546
01:41:34,865 --> 01:41:36,205
You please don't go!

1547
01:41:37,905 --> 01:41:39,455
Who will look after you now?

1548
01:41:40,825 --> 01:41:43,325
Lush forests have become wastelands!

1549
01:41:43,325 --> 01:41:44,615
May you have a boy baby, dear...

1550
01:41:44,905 --> 01:41:45,615
Why?

1551
01:41:45,825 --> 01:41:47,155
Has no one told you?

1552
01:41:47,365 --> 01:41:48,655
How it is in this place?

1553
01:41:48,905 --> 01:41:50,575
If a girl baby is born here...

1554
01:41:50,575 --> 01:41:52,325
We ourselves kill it!

1555
01:41:55,745 --> 01:41:56,285
Oh! God!

1556
01:41:57,205 --> 01:41:58,365
Let me have a baby boy please!

1557
01:41:59,745 --> 01:42:01,285
Let me have a baby boy please!

1558
01:42:02,325 --> 01:42:04,995
It became a graveyard of innocent lives!

1559
01:42:08,115 --> 01:42:10,285
Why have you kept all the ration there?

1560
01:42:12,035 --> 01:42:13,245
See what will happen now!

1561
01:42:14,075 --> 01:42:14,705
Hey...

1562
01:42:15,075 --> 01:42:16,205
Take away the rations!

1563
01:42:18,405 --> 01:42:22,825
The wretched demons who suck
the hot blood of poor people...

1564
01:42:23,825 --> 01:42:27,325
Cruel devils who cut the body
and devour the flesh!

1565
01:42:32,655 --> 01:42:34,245
The breath too has sucked

1566
01:42:34,245 --> 01:42:36,155
the lives of the poor souls...

1567
01:42:37,035 --> 01:42:39,365
With self-respect I carried the body

1568
01:42:39,365 --> 01:42:41,245
and reached the graveyard!

1569
01:42:41,455 --> 01:42:43,995
The sagging gait and the bent head!

1570
01:42:44,285 --> 01:42:45,995
A fistfull of curses in destiny's writings...

1571
01:42:46,655 --> 01:42:51,075
Made them lose faith in the creator!

1572
01:42:52,075 --> 01:42:54,955
Made them lose their very faith!

1573
01:43:08,365 --> 01:43:09,615
But...

1574
01:43:12,955 --> 01:43:15,035
Cutting the creator's chains...

1575
01:43:15,495 --> 01:43:17,365
Broadening the chest with pride

1576
01:43:17,365 --> 01:43:19,955
As the Lord who nips the lives of the raging demons!

1577
01:43:19,955 --> 01:43:21,785
The belief of those who were oppressed and deppressed!

1578
01:43:22,075 --> 01:43:24,615
Was borne by a great mother!

1579
01:43:26,155 --> 01:43:29,245
In the womb, as you contain me...

1580
01:43:29,245 --> 01:43:31,955
In the town, as you walk...

1581
01:43:31,995 --> 01:43:37,115
Seems like you are majestically sitting in a chariot...
Oh! Mother!

1582
01:43:38,075 --> 01:43:40,995
When I felt a ghost nearing me,

1583
01:43:40,995 --> 01:43:43,455
and was transfixed with fright

1584
01:43:43,955 --> 01:43:48,705
You made my mind free of fear...
Oh! Mother!

1585
01:43:50,075 --> 01:43:53,075
To the unseen God...

1586
01:43:53,075 --> 01:43:55,995
I refuse to pay obeisance with folded hands...

1587
01:43:55,995 --> 01:44:00,865
To you, my life's breath itself
is the ritual of worship!

1588
01:44:08,205 --> 01:44:09,745
I can't take it anymore!

1589
01:44:15,825 --> 01:44:17,615
After you are born

1590
01:44:18,615 --> 01:44:20,245
you should become a strong man...

1591
01:44:20,745 --> 01:44:22,535
You should look after me...

1592
01:44:24,405 --> 01:44:26,325
For those who are in trouble like me...

1593
01:44:29,405 --> 01:44:31,115
You should look after those people...

1594
01:44:35,575 --> 01:44:37,205
Come fast my dear...

1595
01:44:38,455 --> 01:44:39,405
Come fast!

1596
01:44:39,905 --> 01:44:40,995
Scattered... Scared and sweating,

1597
01:44:40,995 --> 01:44:44,285
when the very moons
were hiding under the shield of the saree...

1598
01:44:44,285 --> 01:44:47,535
A fiery woman gave birth to a volcano then!

1599
01:44:59,995 --> 01:45:02,865
Like the rains that pour incessently in the blazing rains!

1600
01:45:02,865 --> 01:45:05,655
Like he who conquered death in the house of death!

1601
01:45:06,035 --> 01:45:08,705
Like a rebellion in the face of riches!

1602
01:45:08,785 --> 01:45:11,205
Like a fatal bow facing a ten headed demon!

1603
01:45:11,285 --> 01:45:13,655
Beyond the inherent anger in him

1604
01:45:13,745 --> 01:45:16,455
Saying 'I am everything'
And questioning the very creator!

1605
01:45:16,615 --> 01:45:17,575
He who thundered

1606
01:45:17,575 --> 01:45:18,955
This is the story of one such hero!

1607
01:45:19,495 --> 01:45:22,035
The story of a brave-heart who went beyond destiny!

1608
01:45:23,325 --> 01:45:24,035
Then...

1609
01:45:25,955 --> 01:45:26,745
What happened to him?

1610
01:45:33,325 --> 01:45:35,575
I will be alive till I have
to hold your hand and make you walk...

1611
01:45:41,615 --> 01:45:45,325
Then I will teach you to even leave my hand
and stand strong against others!

1612
01:45:51,865 --> 01:45:54,325
Like the time that stood still in front of death!

1613
01:45:57,205 --> 01:45:59,035
Just kill him even if he takes a small step!

1614
01:46:00,705 --> 01:46:03,655
Like the king who defeated death itself!

1615
01:46:06,325 --> 01:46:07,655
Stamping the burning embers

1616
01:46:07,655 --> 01:46:09,535
and walking on swords that slit!

1617
01:46:10,325 --> 01:46:12,615
Killing the fear that raged in his heart!

1618
01:46:16,615 --> 01:46:19,035
Like a brave heart who punishes,
he walked on!

1619
01:46:26,995 --> 01:46:29,205
Hunting the hunters...

1620
01:46:30,745 --> 01:46:34,405
Came the warrior among hunters!

1621
01:46:35,745 --> 01:46:39,115
To stop this sight of slavery...
Come... Oh! King!

1622
01:46:39,615 --> 01:46:42,995
The hapless life's breath you guard...
Oh! King!

1623
01:46:43,455 --> 01:46:46,365
Like an engulfed flame...
Spreading wild!

1624
01:46:46,365 --> 01:46:47,535
You arrive!

1625
01:46:47,745 --> 01:46:50,705
Hey...

1626
01:46:50,705 --> 01:46:54,075
To authorize a new dawn rightfully...
Come... Oh! King!

1627
01:46:54,575 --> 01:46:57,955
The hapless life's breath you guard...
Oh! King!

1628
01:46:58,405 --> 01:47:01,325
To shake the skies and the earth....

1629
01:47:01,325 --> 01:47:03,405
You arrive!

1630
01:47:13,365 --> 01:47:15,155
Are you a gutsy warrior?

1631
01:47:15,155 --> 01:47:17,075
Are you a brave-heart?

1632
01:47:17,075 --> 01:47:20,455
Or are you a demon?

1633
01:47:20,865 --> 01:47:22,655
Are you a gutsy warrior?

1634
01:47:22,655 --> 01:47:24,575
Are you a brave-heart?

1635
01:47:24,575 --> 01:47:27,955
Or are you a demon?

1636
01:47:29,075 --> 01:47:31,655
What a class act!
I was sure that he will definitely come!

1637
01:47:36,825 --> 01:47:41,825
In loneliness...
I am engulfed!

1638
01:47:41,825 --> 01:47:45,655
In adulation I wait...

1639
01:47:45,655 --> 01:47:49,155
Oh! my Emperor!
To me...

1640
01:47:49,155 --> 01:47:51,155
Come to rule over me!

1641
01:47:51,705 --> 01:47:56,245
Seeing you in your glory...

1642
01:47:56,905 --> 01:48:00,365
I am drawn to you...

1643
01:48:00,365 --> 01:48:03,995
Shall I pleasingly soothe you...

1644
01:48:03,995 --> 01:48:06,405
With my words?

1645
01:48:35,995 --> 01:48:39,495
The threat on our lives, you wipe it...
Come... Oh! King!

1646
01:48:39,785 --> 01:48:43,155
The slaved minds to guard!
Oh! King!

1647
01:48:43,535 --> 01:48:46,455
Shaking the very earth you walk on...

1648
01:48:46,455 --> 01:48:48,535
You arrive!

1649
01:48:50,705 --> 01:48:54,205
The perspiration of fear, you wipe it...
Come... Oh! King!

1650
01:48:54,495 --> 01:48:57,865
The deafening thunder you caution and stand!
Oh! King!

1651
01:48:58,705 --> 01:49:01,615
Like an engulfed flame...
Spreading wild!

1652
01:49:01,615 --> 01:49:03,705
You arrive!

1653
01:49:05,655 --> 01:49:07,455
Are you a gutsy warrior?

1654
01:49:07,455 --> 01:49:09,365
Are you a brave-heart?

1655
01:49:09,365 --> 01:49:12,745
Or are you a demon?

1656
01:49:13,205 --> 01:49:14,995
Are you a gutsy warrior?

1657
01:49:14,995 --> 01:49:16,905
Are you a brave-heart?

1658
01:49:16,905 --> 01:49:20,285
Or are you a demon?

1659
01:49:20,705 --> 01:49:23,035
A respectful welcome!

1660
01:49:24,455 --> 01:49:26,785
A respectful welcome!

1661
01:49:28,205 --> 01:49:30,075
A respectful welcome!

1662
01:49:35,125 --> 01:49:36,665
You are really gutsy sir,

1663
01:49:36,785 --> 01:49:38,535
without even anybody telling you,
you have come forward!

1664
01:49:38,665 --> 01:49:40,125
For this, why do you need guts man!

1665
01:49:40,495 --> 01:49:42,165
your article itself will not get published...

1666
01:49:42,495 --> 01:49:43,245
Why?

1667
01:49:43,245 --> 01:49:44,285
Will he allow that!

1668
01:49:46,625 --> 01:49:47,915
Without even being seen by anyone,

1669
01:49:47,915 --> 01:49:49,625
sitting somewhere and making deals

1670
01:49:50,335 --> 01:49:51,625
does that mean that he is such a coward?

1671
01:49:52,835 --> 01:49:53,995
Even if I get three kings,

1672
01:49:53,995 --> 01:49:57,085
the opponent must be having three aces
is how the world thinks,

1673
01:49:57,375 --> 01:49:59,995
but he never bothered about the people in front of him!

1674
01:50:00,205 --> 01:50:02,035
He was the winner with a blind man's bluff!

1675
01:50:02,955 --> 01:50:04,995
I will tell you another incident, listen...

1676
01:50:04,995 --> 01:50:06,745
Once there was an attack in a pub,

1677
01:50:06,745 --> 01:50:08,455
about twenty people with guns

1678
01:50:11,745 --> 01:50:12,785
Started firing...

1679
01:50:12,785 --> 01:50:14,375
The entire pub got destroyed!

1680
01:50:17,785 --> 01:50:18,835
Hey... Supplier...

1681
01:50:19,035 --> 01:50:20,415
What did you say it's name was?

1682
01:50:20,415 --> 01:50:22,085
M16 Automatic, sir...

1683
01:50:23,995 --> 01:50:26,125
So many people...
Why did they attack him sir?

1684
01:50:26,125 --> 01:50:26,705
Hey...

1685
01:50:26,745 --> 01:50:27,665
That is wrong,

1686
01:50:27,785 --> 01:50:28,705
don't write it like that!

1687
01:50:33,585 --> 01:50:34,665
Sir... They will come sir!

1688
01:50:35,085 --> 01:50:37,705
The twenty people hadn't come to attack him,

1689
01:50:37,705 --> 01:50:40,535
he had come to attack those twenty people!

1690
01:50:40,995 --> 01:50:43,915
to make sure that no one escapes, he sat at the main door,

1691
01:50:43,915 --> 01:50:47,585
to check the guns the supplier brought,
directly he had come to the field,

1692
01:50:48,035 --> 01:50:48,915
Alone...

1693
01:50:49,495 --> 01:50:50,035
Hey...

1694
01:50:50,245 --> 01:50:52,335
We are so many here, each of us have a gun,

1695
01:50:52,375 --> 01:50:53,035
he has come alone,

1696
01:50:53,035 --> 01:50:53,955
why are you afraid?

1697
01:50:55,705 --> 01:50:56,955
Although so many of us are here,

1698
01:50:57,035 --> 01:50:58,665
Even if we have a gun...

1699
01:50:58,875 --> 01:50:59,955
he has come alone,

1700
01:51:00,205 --> 01:51:01,375
won't I get scared?

1701
01:51:03,705 --> 01:51:05,955
You must fear a little at least in life sir...

1702
01:51:05,955 --> 01:51:07,125
Correct man...

1703
01:51:07,625 --> 01:51:09,745
In life there should be fear,

1704
01:51:09,745 --> 01:51:11,665
the fear should be there in the heart

1705
01:51:12,785 --> 01:51:15,285
But the heart that fears should not be ours

1706
01:51:15,285 --> 01:51:17,335
it must be that of our opponents!

1707
01:51:19,285 --> 01:51:20,785
May I come in?

1708
01:51:21,495 --> 01:51:23,285
Is he such a big gangster?

1709
01:51:24,035 --> 01:51:26,335
The one who comes with a gang is a gangster!

1710
01:51:26,535 --> 01:51:27,835
He comes alone...

1711
01:51:32,535 --> 01:51:33,995
Monster!

1712
01:51:38,665 --> 01:51:39,285
Anand...

1713
01:51:44,165 --> 01:51:45,415
Again did I jump ahead...

1714
01:51:52,035 --> 01:51:53,085
In KGF,

1715
01:51:53,245 --> 01:51:55,875
about the internal scheming and brawls

1716
01:51:56,995 --> 01:51:58,665
Suryavardhan knew,

1717
01:52:00,625 --> 01:52:02,125
In the coming days

1718
01:52:02,455 --> 01:52:03,995
bigger battles will
come

1719
01:52:03,995 --> 01:52:06,745
to the doors of KGF
was also known by him!

1720
01:52:16,585 --> 01:52:18,085
What Mr. Desai?

1721
01:52:18,085 --> 01:52:19,745
You have come this far?
To Delhi...

1722
01:52:20,335 --> 01:52:21,995
The sword which was getting ready in the furnace

1723
01:52:21,995 --> 01:52:23,285
has now come on my neck!

1724
01:52:23,285 --> 01:52:24,245
That's why!

1725
01:52:29,245 --> 01:52:30,585
Was it all for this...

1726
01:52:30,585 --> 01:52:31,745
Uncle went,

1727
01:52:32,625 --> 01:52:33,955
now even dad is going

1728
01:52:34,285 --> 01:52:36,745
Till you see our blood spill, wont you stop??

1729
01:52:37,375 --> 01:52:39,625
I don't know for how many days Boss will survive...

1730
01:52:39,625 --> 01:52:42,335
After he leaves, have you thought
about what will happen to all of us??

1731
01:52:42,535 --> 01:52:44,915
On my behalf, you all are busy thinking,

1732
01:52:45,835 --> 01:52:47,035
With a fish in your hand

1733
01:52:47,035 --> 01:52:48,955
you are trying to hunt a crocodile,

1734
01:52:49,335 --> 01:52:52,625
but for the crocodile your hand looks tastier
than the fish.

1735
01:52:53,125 --> 01:52:56,785
Just looking at hands full of blood
if you are getting so scared,

1736
01:52:56,835 --> 01:52:59,375
before a river of blood flows

1737
01:52:59,375 --> 01:53:01,035
you get out of here!

1738
01:53:03,085 --> 01:53:06,205
The vultures are hovering around Narachi!

1739
01:53:06,745 --> 01:53:09,585
Don't bother about the smaller waves...

1740
01:53:09,585 --> 01:53:11,875
We have more headaches to worry about!

1741
01:53:11,875 --> 01:53:13,875
After I depart,

1742
01:53:14,205 --> 01:53:16,495
bigger Tsunamis will approach!

1743
01:53:17,205 --> 01:53:18,995
Inayath Khaleel!

1744
01:53:21,455 --> 01:53:23,875
He is waiting since many years!

1745
01:53:23,995 --> 01:53:25,915
Once if he enters...

1746
01:53:25,915 --> 01:53:27,585
He will never leave!

1747
01:53:29,995 --> 01:53:32,535
This time's election,
do you know who is going to contest?

1748
01:53:33,915 --> 01:53:35,705
Ramika Sen

1749
01:53:35,705 --> 01:53:37,995
We all pay money to get a salute...

1750
01:53:38,165 --> 01:53:39,535
On hearing her name itself

1751
01:53:39,535 --> 01:53:41,705
people stand and salute her!

1752
01:53:41,705 --> 01:53:43,835
If she comes to power...

1753
01:53:46,625 --> 01:53:47,705
These two are enough...

1754
01:53:48,165 --> 01:53:49,745
To spoil this kingdom!

1755
01:53:50,915 --> 01:53:52,415
Think about them!

1756
01:53:59,745 --> 01:54:00,995
How are you now?

1757
01:54:02,205 --> 01:54:04,835
Is he the guy who killed the girl child?

1758
01:54:32,665 --> 01:54:34,245
What happened to the matchbox I kept here?

1759
01:54:48,495 --> 01:54:49,745
Felt like someone pushed me...

1760
01:54:51,455 --> 01:54:53,455
Fire! Fire...

1761
01:54:55,035 --> 01:54:56,205
Hey...
Stop man!

1762
01:54:56,375 --> 01:54:57,495
There must be 105 people...

1763
01:54:57,625 --> 01:54:58,585
First take their count!

1764
01:55:00,665 --> 01:55:01,035
1,

1765
01:55:01,375 --> 01:55:01,745
2,

1766
01:55:02,165 --> 01:55:02,785
3,

1767
01:55:02,875 --> 01:55:03,455
4,

1768
01:55:03,585 --> 01:55:03,955
5,

1769
01:55:04,285 --> 01:55:04,665
6,

1770
01:55:04,995 --> 01:55:05,415
7,

1771
01:55:05,785 --> 01:55:06,205
8,

1772
01:55:06,455 --> 01:55:06,835
9,

1773
01:55:07,165 --> 01:55:07,585
10,

1774
01:55:07,955 --> 01:55:08,335
11,

1775
01:55:08,665 --> 01:55:09,035
12,

1776
01:55:09,335 --> 01:55:09,705
13,

1777
01:55:09,995 --> 01:55:10,495
14,

1778
01:55:10,875 --> 01:55:11,245
19,

1779
01:55:11,455 --> 01:55:12,035
16,

1780
01:55:12,165 --> 01:55:12,745
17,

1781
01:55:12,915 --> 01:55:13,495
18,

1782
01:55:13,665 --> 01:55:14,035
15,

1783
01:55:14,375 --> 01:55:14,745
20,

1784
01:55:15,085 --> 01:55:15,455
21,

1785
01:55:15,785 --> 01:55:16,165
22,

1786
01:55:16,585 --> 01:55:17,205
23,

1787
01:55:17,285 --> 01:55:17,875
24,

1788
01:55:17,995 --> 01:55:18,375
25,

1789
01:55:18,995 --> 01:55:19,535
26,

1790
01:55:19,665 --> 01:55:20,205
27,

1791
01:55:20,335 --> 01:55:20,955
28,

1792
01:55:20,955 --> 01:55:21,415
29,

1793
01:55:21,415 --> 01:55:22,035
30,

1794
01:55:22,495 --> 01:55:22,875
31,

1795
01:55:23,205 --> 01:55:23,585
32,

1796
01:55:23,995 --> 01:55:24,625
33,

1797
01:55:24,705 --> 01:55:25,285
34,

1798
01:55:25,415 --> 01:55:25,785
35,

1799
01:55:26,085 --> 01:55:26,455
36,

1800
01:55:26,875 --> 01:55:27,585
37,

1801
01:56:05,665 --> 01:56:06,245
91,

1802
01:56:06,245 --> 01:56:06,995
92,

1803
01:56:06,995 --> 01:56:07,705
93,

1804
01:56:07,705 --> 01:56:08,415
94,

1805
01:56:08,585 --> 01:56:09,245
95,

1806
01:56:09,245 --> 01:56:09,955
96,
- Lorry,

1807
01:56:09,955 --> 01:56:11,535
97, 98
- Lorry!

1808
01:56:11,535 --> 01:56:12,375
99,

1809
01:56:12,375 --> 01:56:13,085
100,

1810
01:56:13,085 --> 01:56:13,785
101,

1811
01:56:13,785 --> 01:56:14,585
102,

1812
01:56:14,585 --> 01:56:15,245
103,

1813
01:56:15,245 --> 01:56:15,955
104,

1814
01:56:15,955 --> 01:56:16,625
105,

1815
01:56:16,955 --> 01:56:17,745
It is correct!

1816
01:56:34,285 --> 01:56:35,455
Today's food...

1817
01:56:36,995 --> 01:56:38,665
You have prepared it very well!

1818
01:56:52,165 --> 01:56:53,165
Take us too!

1819
01:56:53,785 --> 01:56:54,585
Where?

1820
01:56:54,955 --> 01:56:55,585
Outside...

1821
01:56:56,495 --> 01:56:57,285
I know!

1822
01:57:00,585 --> 01:57:02,165
If you open your mouth, I will kill you!

1823
01:57:04,625 --> 01:57:05,625
I will fall at your feet!

1824
01:57:24,785 --> 01:57:27,285
Someone's hand is behind the incident
that happened near the maintenance room!

1825
01:57:27,285 --> 01:57:28,245
It felt like someone...

1826
01:57:28,245 --> 01:57:29,745
Felt like someone hit me with a hammer!

1827
01:57:30,205 --> 01:57:31,915
Even though there is so much security,

1828
01:57:31,915 --> 01:57:33,035
someone has barged inside

1829
01:57:33,035 --> 01:57:34,285
and has seen the map,

1830
01:57:34,585 --> 01:57:36,415
the batch that came two day's earlier,

1831
01:57:36,415 --> 01:57:39,535
one of them has come to kill you, I feel!

1832
01:57:40,665 --> 01:57:42,125
To hit me??

1833
01:57:42,125 --> 01:57:43,125
Here??

1834
01:57:43,125 --> 01:57:46,495
Drinking the gruel you give over and again,

1835
01:57:46,495 --> 01:57:47,995
he would have gone to eat a bun

1836
01:57:47,995 --> 01:57:49,285
in the maintenance room!

1837
01:57:49,415 --> 01:57:51,245
We can't take the risk!

1838
01:57:52,085 --> 01:57:53,205
Then...

1839
01:57:53,205 --> 01:57:56,915
Call every single one who worked In that zone!

1840
01:58:14,665 --> 01:58:15,745
Hello! Hello!

1841
01:58:16,035 --> 01:58:17,915
Junior Boss is coming near the hutments..

1842
01:58:17,915 --> 01:58:18,535
Over!

1843
01:58:34,705 --> 01:58:37,035
Who was it who entered the maintenance room?

1844
01:58:37,535 --> 01:58:39,205
If you come by yourself...

1845
01:58:39,205 --> 01:58:40,835
Then only you will die...

1846
01:58:41,125 --> 01:58:42,455
Otherwise...

1847
01:58:42,455 --> 01:58:44,035
Everyone will die!

1848
01:58:45,495 --> 01:58:46,335
Gun...

1849
01:59:11,285 --> 01:59:13,245
If you know who he is, tell us...

1850
01:59:13,415 --> 01:59:14,665
Your life will be spared!

1851
01:59:58,125 --> 02:00:00,495
The one who doesn't even know how to hold a sword,

1852
02:00:00,785 --> 02:00:02,455
will they call him to kill me?

1853
02:00:06,625 --> 02:00:09,285
The one who crossed the maintenance room has been killed...

1854
02:00:09,285 --> 02:00:11,455
Now the Junior Boss is going towards the Palace...
Over!

1855
02:00:14,705 --> 02:00:16,085
Hello...
Your man has been caught,

1856
02:00:16,085 --> 02:00:17,165
They shot him!

1857
02:00:17,165 --> 02:00:17,535
What??

1858
02:00:19,835 --> 02:00:20,415
What happened?

1859
02:00:20,665 --> 02:00:21,585
They killed Rocky, it seems!

1860
02:00:23,955 --> 02:00:25,085
I told you that day itself,

1861
02:00:25,745 --> 02:00:27,495
Calling that person from Bombay,
all of you...

1862
02:00:27,495 --> 02:00:29,205
Now who you will call and what will you do,
is left to you!

1863
02:00:59,915 --> 02:01:00,705
It's a baby girl!

1864
02:01:43,625 --> 02:01:45,085
For the sake of this child,

1865
02:01:45,335 --> 02:01:47,535
yesterday her father gave up his life!

1866
02:01:48,245 --> 02:01:49,335
Take us too with you!

1867
02:01:49,535 --> 02:01:52,165
Yesterday if he had not come forward,

1868
02:01:52,165 --> 02:01:55,085
With me, they would have killed his pregnant wife!

1869
02:02:02,415 --> 02:02:04,495
But, now they will target him!

1870
02:02:04,495 --> 02:02:06,835
He... He...
He will protect us!

1871
02:02:07,535 --> 02:02:12,335
For the palace of a million dreams,

1872
02:02:12,995 --> 02:02:18,955
I will stand guard, as a soldier...
Oh! Mother!

1873
02:02:19,285 --> 02:02:24,245
To the plough that plows the land carefully,

1874
02:02:24,835 --> 02:02:30,955
To provide a strong shoulder of support for it,
I will stand... Oh! Mother!

1875
02:02:31,495 --> 02:02:34,285
When a burning flame flows...

1876
02:02:34,285 --> 02:02:37,165
Burning the world,

1877
02:02:37,585 --> 02:02:42,125
The soothing rain I will become,
Listen... Oh! Mother!

1878
02:02:42,875 --> 02:02:44,585
At least once,

1879
02:02:44,955 --> 02:02:48,035
I am hoping that the story he tells should become true!

1880
02:03:19,085 --> 02:03:20,165
Mama...

1881
02:03:33,955 --> 02:03:39,625
Mama...

1882
02:04:09,375 --> 02:04:09,915
Hey...

1883
02:04:11,205 --> 02:04:12,955
Let us finish the work and leave!

1884
02:04:18,105 --> 02:04:19,815
Walk on...
Keep walking...

1885
02:04:19,815 --> 02:04:21,395
Walk with your heads down!

1886
02:04:21,395 --> 02:04:23,525
Go faster guys!

1887
02:04:23,695 --> 02:04:25,525
Go faster! Go faster!

1888
02:04:39,195 --> 02:04:40,565
Guys... Run... Run... Run!

1889
02:04:57,985 --> 02:04:58,855
Boss!

1890
02:04:58,855 --> 02:04:59,815
What happened boss...

1891
02:04:59,815 --> 02:05:01,145
Remove your turban...

1892
02:05:02,985 --> 02:05:03,605
Brother...

1893
02:05:07,355 --> 02:05:08,605
Take off your turban, I say!!

1894
02:05:13,485 --> 02:05:16,065
If you bring the turban and toss it in this basket

1895
02:05:16,065 --> 02:05:17,145
I will let you go!

1896
02:05:29,395 --> 02:05:30,355
Please don't...

1897
02:06:12,105 --> 02:06:14,105
Go... Go! Go away....
What are you standing and looking at?

1898
02:06:14,105 --> 02:06:15,195
Go... Go!

1899
02:06:15,195 --> 02:06:16,445
They knew he was blind,

1900
02:06:16,445 --> 02:06:18,065
but your hero didn't do anything...

1901
02:06:18,275 --> 02:06:19,565
Too much risk to take!

1902
02:06:19,565 --> 02:06:20,355
Sir!!

1903
02:06:20,355 --> 02:06:21,695
Why is he so quiet?

1904
02:06:21,695 --> 02:06:22,815
Why is he so silent?
Tell me sir?

1905
02:06:22,815 --> 02:06:23,985
Listen...
Now you are getting on my nerves!

1906
02:06:23,985 --> 02:06:25,065
One minute Madam...
One minute...

1907
02:06:25,065 --> 02:06:26,695
Sir, will he go back??

1908
02:06:28,395 --> 02:06:29,605
Won't he do anything??

1909
02:06:33,485 --> 02:06:34,815
We can't do anything...

1910
02:06:36,195 --> 02:06:38,525
We can't rush and create history!

1911
02:06:39,195 --> 02:06:40,195
Go guys!

1912
02:06:40,275 --> 02:06:41,645
Go to hell!

1913
02:06:42,275 --> 02:06:43,025
Leave it...

1914
02:06:43,275 --> 02:06:44,395
What can be done??

1915
02:06:44,395 --> 02:06:45,315
Hey... Leave...

1916
02:06:45,315 --> 02:06:47,485
Today I will kill him...

1917
02:06:47,485 --> 02:06:49,235
Be quite... Today I will kill him!

1918
02:06:49,645 --> 02:06:50,695
He has become old...

1919
02:06:50,695 --> 02:06:51,895
Wait man, wait!

1920
02:06:51,895 --> 02:06:53,695
How long will he live?

1921
02:06:53,695 --> 02:06:55,025
Let him die and live peacefully in heaven...

1922
02:06:55,025 --> 02:06:55,895
Hey...

1923
02:06:56,525 --> 02:06:58,775
Let him decide...
Leave him guy!

1924
02:06:59,025 --> 02:07:01,855
Whose plate he stamps

1925
02:07:01,855 --> 02:07:03,485
he must kill him!

1926
02:07:03,485 --> 02:07:05,395
Write your names on the plate...

1927
02:07:05,645 --> 02:07:06,815
Hey, write my name...

1928
02:07:06,815 --> 02:07:09,195
What's the point in standing and watching?

1929
02:07:09,195 --> 02:07:09,945
Let's move...

1930
02:07:10,105 --> 02:07:11,445
You don't bother listening to them...

1931
02:07:11,445 --> 02:07:12,105
Just leave!

1932
02:07:12,105 --> 02:07:14,735
Till now no one has touched them!

1933
02:07:15,235 --> 02:07:16,605
No one can even touch them...

1934
02:07:18,025 --> 02:07:20,315
Go, go...
Alongwith the old man, dig a grave for the baby too!

1935
02:07:22,525 --> 02:07:23,605
Don't cry baby...

1936
02:07:23,945 --> 02:07:24,855
Don't cry...

1937
02:07:26,815 --> 02:07:29,025
You can't rush and create history,

1938
02:07:30,445 --> 02:07:31,985
that does not mean

1939
02:07:31,985 --> 02:07:32,985
that you can plan history

1940
02:07:32,985 --> 02:07:34,355
and create a blueprint for it!

1941
02:07:44,485 --> 02:07:46,065
It just needs a spark!

1942
02:07:46,275 --> 02:07:47,775
Why did you stand up?

1943
02:07:48,105 --> 02:07:49,395
Keep that and leave...

1944
02:07:49,855 --> 02:07:50,565
That day,

1945
02:07:52,195 --> 02:07:53,895
The forest blazed furiously

1946
02:07:54,395 --> 02:07:58,395
Hidden in the depths of his being,
The burning embers he unleashed, the lion-hearted brave-heart!

1947
02:08:01,855 --> 02:08:05,735
Taunting every atom and every footprint,
Unleashing unbridled wrath, the magnificent warrior!

1948
02:08:06,395 --> 02:08:09,065
No More 'Shut up Rocky!'

1949
02:08:09,735 --> 02:08:15,445
Provoking the Warrior Dynasty, disturbing the very depths of the ocean...
Such a brave-heart, is this Emperor!

1950
02:08:17,195 --> 02:08:23,195
Provoking the Warrior Dynasty, disturbing the very depths of the ocean...
Such a brave-heart, is this Emperor!

1951
02:08:36,065 --> 02:08:37,695
Have you seen anyone jump so high?

1952
02:09:12,605 --> 02:09:15,985
He came...

1953
02:09:15,985 --> 02:09:17,645
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

1954
02:09:17,645 --> 02:09:19,485
This emperor is a gutsy warrior!!

1955
02:09:19,485 --> 02:09:21,605
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

1956
02:09:21,605 --> 02:09:23,445
This emperor is a gutsy warrior!!

1957
02:09:23,445 --> 02:09:25,565
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

1958
02:09:25,565 --> 02:09:27,395
This emperor is a gutsy warrior!!

1959
02:09:27,395 --> 02:09:29,525
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

1960
02:09:29,525 --> 02:09:31,065
This emperor is a gutsy warrior!!

1961
02:09:38,565 --> 02:09:39,445
Walk on...

1962
02:09:40,355 --> 02:09:41,695
No! He missed my plate!

1963
02:09:42,695 --> 02:09:43,645
Mine too he missed!

1964
02:09:44,985 --> 02:09:46,025
He missed it!

1965
02:09:51,855 --> 02:09:55,695
Everytime he gets the chance!

1966
02:09:56,565 --> 02:09:58,985
Hide and seek...

1967
02:09:58,985 --> 02:10:00,945
Forest and nest,

1968
02:10:00,945 --> 02:10:02,855
The bag of grains

1969
02:10:03,195 --> 02:10:05,355
It rolled and fell,

1970
02:10:05,355 --> 02:10:07,445
My bird flew away,

1971
02:10:07,445 --> 02:10:09,565
I left it to fly!

1972
02:10:09,565 --> 02:10:11,855
Your bird...

1973
02:10:11,855 --> 02:10:13,355
Catch it guys!

1974
02:10:15,605 --> 02:10:17,145
Hey... What happened to the electricity man?

1975
02:10:18,945 --> 02:10:20,565
Go and see what happened guys...

1976
02:10:24,855 --> 02:10:26,485
Who removed the fuse?

1977
02:10:29,945 --> 02:10:32,565
It's Kencha... Run, run!

1978
02:10:37,195 --> 02:10:38,855
Hey... Who hit him?

1979
02:10:40,895 --> 02:10:42,105
Where is Naga?

1980
02:10:45,605 --> 02:10:46,815
Who killed Muththa?

1981
02:10:49,735 --> 02:10:50,945
They both are not to be seen guys!

1982
02:11:14,395 --> 02:11:15,695
Kill him guys!

1983
02:13:00,815 --> 02:13:01,395
Is he here?

1984
02:13:02,565 --> 02:13:03,145
18,

1985
02:13:03,145 --> 02:13:03,945
19,

1986
02:13:03,945 --> 02:13:04,645
20,

1987
02:13:04,645 --> 02:13:05,605
21,

1988
02:13:05,605 --> 02:13:06,315
22,

1989
02:13:06,315 --> 02:13:07,735
including you it's 23!

1990
02:13:08,275 --> 02:13:09,985
Is the calculation correct man?

1991
02:13:39,315 --> 02:13:40,775
Have you beaten everybody?

1992
02:13:43,105 --> 02:13:44,775
I left one man...

1993
02:13:46,605 --> 02:13:48,445
For the procession!

1994
02:14:03,445 --> 02:14:07,105
The seeds planted in your heart,
you will ever remember!

1995
02:14:07,105 --> 02:14:11,105
In muddy roads, thorny paths abound!

1996
02:14:11,105 --> 02:14:13,985
Whatever be the obstacle...

1997
02:14:13,985 --> 02:14:16,695
Cross it and come...

1998
02:14:18,775 --> 02:14:20,855
Cross the darkest night...

1999
02:14:20,855 --> 02:14:24,605
Bring the dawn with you...

2000
02:14:32,065 --> 02:14:33,735
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

2001
02:14:33,735 --> 02:14:35,775
He wields the sword of lightning!!

2002
02:14:35,775 --> 02:14:37,895
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

2003
02:14:37,895 --> 02:14:39,735
The saviour of the masses is a gutsy warrior!!

2004
02:14:39,735 --> 02:14:41,855
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

2005
02:14:41,855 --> 02:14:43,695
He wields the sword of lightning!!

2006
02:14:43,695 --> 02:14:45,645
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

2007
02:14:45,645 --> 02:14:47,315
The saviour of the masses is a gutsy warrior!!

2008
02:14:50,275 --> 02:14:51,945
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

2009
02:14:51,945 --> 02:14:53,985
He wields the sword of lightning!!

2010
02:14:53,985 --> 02:14:56,105
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

2011
02:14:56,105 --> 02:14:57,945
The saviour of the masses is a gutsy warrior!!

2012
02:15:22,565 --> 02:15:25,695
They are hitting so hard today!

2013
02:15:26,235 --> 02:15:28,605
Someone's luck must have run out!

2014
02:16:28,815 --> 02:16:29,145
He...

2015
02:16:29,145 --> 02:16:30,315
For the sake of the old man...

2016
02:16:30,315 --> 02:16:31,485
For the sake of the baby...

2017
02:16:31,485 --> 02:16:32,895
For their pain,

2018
02:16:33,395 --> 02:16:34,645
or for his own self...

2019
02:16:34,645 --> 02:16:36,105
Did he beat all of them...

2020
02:16:36,355 --> 02:16:37,065
But,

2021
02:16:37,445 --> 02:16:38,945
to all there,

2022
02:16:39,145 --> 02:16:41,485
at least for sometime they felt relief...

2023
02:16:43,985 --> 02:16:46,025
In all the cinemas,
there is one person right?

2024
02:16:46,275 --> 02:16:48,355
If I keep seeing you, I feel the same way!

2025
02:16:48,355 --> 02:16:49,025
Are you the hero?

2026
02:16:49,025 --> 02:16:49,775
No...

2027
02:16:49,985 --> 02:16:51,315
Villan!

2028
02:16:54,195 --> 02:16:55,395
Don't worry!!

2029
02:16:55,645 --> 02:16:56,735
We will bury him...

2030
02:16:57,105 --> 02:16:58,145
Burn it...

2031
02:16:58,445 --> 02:16:59,235
Why??

2032
02:17:01,605 --> 02:17:02,945
I am ready now!

2033
02:17:07,155 --> 02:17:08,985
Where is everyone?

2034
02:17:09,065 --> 02:17:11,235
Inform the office that no one can be seen!

2035
02:17:11,605 --> 02:17:13,525
By the time the village fair is over,

2036
02:17:13,525 --> 02:17:16,025
we want to run away somewhere...

2037
02:17:16,565 --> 02:17:19,155
You go to some other country...

2038
02:17:19,155 --> 02:17:20,735
By believing just one man!

2039
02:17:20,735 --> 02:17:22,195
we made a big mistake!

2040
02:17:32,025 --> 02:17:32,855
Rocky...

2041
02:17:33,315 --> 02:17:34,605
He is still alive...

2042
02:17:38,565 --> 02:17:40,195
He has sent a signal...

2043
02:17:40,355 --> 02:17:42,775
Once you are ready, send a big signal...

2044
02:17:42,775 --> 02:17:43,945
In a big way!

2045
02:17:44,235 --> 02:17:45,155
A big signal!

2046
02:17:56,355 --> 02:17:58,155
Near the huts, a big fire is burning,

2047
02:17:58,155 --> 02:18:00,155
The 23 guards in the Mine are missing...

2048
02:18:00,235 --> 02:18:02,065
Everyone go near the huts, right away!

2049
02:18:02,065 --> 02:18:05,525
The missing 23 guards must have be killed by Rocky

2050
02:18:05,525 --> 02:18:08,275
and to make sure their bodies are not found,
he must have burned them!

2051
02:18:08,275 --> 02:18:09,945
That means, we must do something...

2052
02:18:09,945 --> 02:18:11,195
We must stop those jeeps...

2053
02:18:11,195 --> 02:18:13,655
or else to get to know that Rocky is behind this,

2054
02:18:13,655 --> 02:18:15,605
they will not hesitate to burn those 20,000 people!

2055
02:18:15,605 --> 02:18:17,155
We must stop those jeeps!

2056
02:18:17,155 --> 02:18:18,405
Something must be done!

2057
02:18:18,775 --> 02:18:19,775
Something must be done!

2058
02:18:22,605 --> 02:18:23,655
Father died...

2059
02:18:50,525 --> 02:18:51,735
The guards are coming here...

2060
02:18:51,735 --> 02:18:53,905
If they see us burning these 23 guards?

2061
02:18:53,905 --> 02:18:54,815
What should we do then?

2062
02:18:54,815 --> 02:18:56,155
Hey...

2063
02:18:56,775 --> 02:18:59,355
The Big Boss has died!

2064
02:19:08,735 --> 02:19:10,195
The Big Boss has died!

2065
02:19:35,985 --> 02:19:37,195
Father...

2066
02:19:37,695 --> 02:19:39,315
Boss...

2067
02:19:41,445 --> 02:19:43,025
The boss has died!

2068
02:19:45,855 --> 02:19:47,065
Lord Muruga...

2069
02:19:51,235 --> 02:19:52,985
Something is not falling in the right place...

2070
02:19:52,985 --> 02:19:54,655
You have a lot of enemies,

2071
02:19:54,735 --> 02:19:55,905
leave the rest for now,

2072
02:19:55,905 --> 02:19:58,275
it will be better if that fair does not take place next week!

2073
02:19:58,445 --> 02:19:59,735
Priest...

2074
02:19:59,735 --> 02:20:00,355
Boss...

2075
02:20:00,355 --> 02:20:02,775
Tonight itself arrange for the Goddesses blessings,

2076
02:20:03,025 --> 02:20:05,355
by dawn tomorrow

2077
02:20:06,565 --> 02:20:08,815
I should not have any enemies!

2078
02:20:09,985 --> 02:20:13,485
On one side, Vaanaram has suspected something
and has tightened the security...

2079
02:20:19,315 --> 02:20:22,195
On the other side, Garuda's brother Virat is waiting...

2080
02:20:22,655 --> 02:20:24,355
No one should be allowed near the Junior Boss's room!

2081
02:20:25,155 --> 02:20:27,905
By dawn, crossing so much security,

2082
02:20:27,905 --> 02:20:29,445
even if he manages to kill Garuda...

2083
02:20:29,445 --> 02:20:30,985
How willl he escape from there?

2084
02:20:32,315 --> 02:20:33,945
I am setting the frequency of the Walky,

2085
02:20:34,315 --> 02:20:35,905
We have to inform something...

2086
02:20:36,525 --> 02:20:37,405
Something!

2087
02:20:37,815 --> 02:20:38,605
Let's go...

2088
02:20:40,485 --> 02:20:41,945
If he does not kill him, what will his fate be,

2089
02:20:42,695 --> 02:20:44,155
what will the fate of the people be?

2090
02:20:46,655 --> 02:20:47,855
You had called for me urgently,

2091
02:20:48,155 --> 02:20:48,735
What's that??

2092
02:20:48,985 --> 02:20:50,275
Which you can't say over the phone?

2093
02:20:50,405 --> 02:20:51,025
Father...

2094
02:20:51,905 --> 02:20:52,775
Will you tell him?

2095
02:20:54,855 --> 02:20:55,815
Or should I tell him??

2096
02:20:58,235 --> 02:21:00,355
Whatever be the place,

2097
02:21:00,605 --> 02:21:02,485
whoever be the people there...

2098
02:21:03,105 --> 02:21:05,525
The guy who went, he is my lover...

2099
02:21:07,275 --> 02:21:08,605
Will you say

2100
02:21:10,155 --> 02:21:11,485
or should I say it!

2101
02:21:15,065 --> 02:21:16,405
I am getting scared!

2102
02:21:16,815 --> 02:21:19,655
Other than getting scared, what have we done?

2103
02:21:21,565 --> 02:21:23,565
From the time these walls have been built,

2104
02:21:23,565 --> 02:21:24,735
I am right here!

2105
02:21:25,025 --> 02:21:26,775
We are living like slaves!

2106
02:21:26,775 --> 02:21:28,945
We will die like slaves, is what I thought!

2107
02:21:30,275 --> 02:21:32,655
But now I have got courage,

2108
02:21:33,445 --> 02:21:34,775
I have got belief!

2109
02:21:35,355 --> 02:21:37,525
Hey.. Hang it on the nail...
- Make way...

2110
02:21:37,525 --> 02:21:38,945
Hang it...
- Fine... Come... Come... Come!

2111
02:21:43,155 --> 02:21:44,195
Who is he,

2112
02:21:44,445 --> 02:21:47,155
why has he come here, I was wondering!

2113
02:21:50,855 --> 02:21:52,155
Now I understood...

2114
02:21:52,855 --> 02:21:56,315
He has come to change fiction into fact!

2115
02:22:16,905 --> 02:22:17,855
There has been a short circuit!

2116
02:22:17,855 --> 02:22:19,195
In the whole town of Narachi, the power has been cut!

2117
02:22:21,855 --> 02:22:23,195
Near Biligere too, the guards are stationed!

2118
02:22:23,905 --> 02:22:25,235
Run towards the Boss's room!

2119
02:22:31,605 --> 02:22:33,735
In front of Junior Boss's room,
the guards are stationed!

2120
02:22:34,855 --> 02:22:37,025
We are escorting him from here to the Goddesses Fair!

2121
02:22:37,025 --> 02:22:37,485
Over!

2122
02:22:39,565 --> 02:22:40,355
Where has he gone?

2123
02:22:40,735 --> 02:22:41,405
Has he run away?

2124
02:22:41,855 --> 02:22:42,355
Has he run away?

2125
02:22:42,355 --> 02:22:44,985
There, in the village fair, the walky signal will get cut!

2126
02:22:44,985 --> 02:22:45,985
Lots of people there,

2127
02:22:45,985 --> 02:22:46,855
be alert...

2128
02:22:46,855 --> 02:22:49,105
No one should even go near the Junior Boss...

2129
02:22:49,105 --> 02:22:49,945
Leave...

2130
02:22:50,565 --> 02:22:51,105
Tell me sir...

2131
02:22:51,485 --> 02:22:52,855
If Rocky does not kill Garuda...

2132
02:22:53,525 --> 02:22:55,065
What will the fate of the people be?

2133
02:22:56,855 --> 02:22:57,735
She is there, right?

2134
02:22:58,945 --> 02:22:59,695
Our mother...

2135
02:23:01,985 --> 02:23:02,905
Goddess Mariamma!

2136
02:23:13,105 --> 02:23:14,445
In the Goddesses fair!

2137
02:23:14,445 --> 02:23:15,485
In the fair...

2138
02:23:15,485 --> 02:23:17,405
In the fair he will kill him!

2139
02:23:27,855 --> 02:23:29,195
The short circuit is near Billigere...

2140
02:23:35,565 --> 02:23:37,155
Because someone rolled the copper wire to a stone

2141
02:23:37,155 --> 02:23:38,855
and threw it on the electrical cable,

2142
02:23:38,855 --> 02:23:41,445
the short circuit has cut the power in the whole town of Narachi!

2143
02:23:47,775 --> 02:23:50,815
Within 10 seconds of the power getting shut,
the jeep lights and torch lights were on!

2144
02:23:50,815 --> 02:23:51,855
In that 10 seconds time,

2145
02:23:51,855 --> 02:23:54,985
it is impossible for anyone to pass unnoticed by us sir...

2146
02:23:57,275 --> 02:23:58,905
Where does this tunnel go?

2147
02:24:00,445 --> 02:24:02,275
In the whole of Naraachi, only this tunnel...

2148
02:24:02,275 --> 02:24:04,065
Goes directly to the Boss's house!

2149
02:24:50,735 --> 02:24:52,405
Even if someone has short circuited it,

2150
02:24:52,405 --> 02:24:54,945
to cross Biligire and then come here through the tunnel,

2151
02:24:54,945 --> 02:24:56,105
they need a lot of time...

2152
02:24:56,105 --> 02:24:57,525
By then, because you alerted them,

2153
02:24:57,525 --> 02:24:59,815
all the guards in the palace,

2154
02:24:59,815 --> 02:25:00,735
came to the Junior Boss's room

2155
02:25:00,735 --> 02:25:01,565
and escorted him to the fair!

2156
02:25:02,155 --> 02:25:03,775
Where else could he have gone...

2157
02:25:11,065 --> 02:25:12,155
Trumpets!

2158
02:25:36,065 --> 02:25:36,905
When the electricity was shut,

2159
02:25:36,905 --> 02:25:39,355
the guards who were here
too had come to the Junior Boss's room...

2160
02:25:40,525 --> 02:25:41,815
You don't worry sir,

2161
02:25:41,985 --> 02:25:44,105
by the time boss finishes the fair and returns,

2162
02:25:44,105 --> 02:25:45,945
the whole palace will be secured...

2163
02:25:51,235 --> 02:25:53,605
Bring the 3 prisioners in front guys...

2164
02:25:58,105 --> 02:25:59,105
Panju...

2165
02:26:16,565 --> 02:26:18,405
He short circuited and cut the electricity

2166
02:26:18,405 --> 02:26:20,525
not to enter the palace but to come here!

2167
02:26:20,775 --> 02:26:22,355
Ramana, he is still there...

2168
02:26:22,355 --> 02:26:24,065
Ramana, I am unable to catch the signal!

2169
02:26:24,065 --> 02:26:25,235
Everyone go to the fair

2170
02:26:25,235 --> 02:26:27,235
and also inform the Barracks and ask everybody to come...

2171
02:26:37,525 --> 02:26:38,445
Ramana...

2172
02:26:38,565 --> 02:26:39,315
Ramana...

2173
02:26:39,775 --> 02:26:41,655
He is still there!

2174
02:26:58,815 --> 02:27:00,355
He is still there Ramana...

2175
02:27:00,945 --> 02:27:01,485
Ramana...

2176
02:27:18,775 --> 02:27:20,735
The cell where the 3 prisioners were,

2177
02:27:21,105 --> 02:27:21,905
One...

2178
02:27:21,905 --> 02:27:23,235
One prisioner is still there...

2179
02:27:45,235 --> 02:27:46,065
Hey...

2180
02:28:03,905 --> 02:28:05,275
Shantamma!

2181
02:28:05,275 --> 02:28:06,445
Hey! Stand right there!
- Mamma... Leave me!

2182
02:28:06,945 --> 02:28:08,025
Your son is going out of control!

2183
02:28:08,025 --> 02:28:09,605
He has formed a gang and has gone to hit them up!

2184
02:28:09,605 --> 02:28:10,565
Not only did he go,

2185
02:28:10,565 --> 02:28:11,945
but he took our children too!

2186
02:28:11,945 --> 02:28:13,105
High time you you advised your son!

2187
02:28:13,105 --> 02:28:15,065
He tortured me in school daily mama!

2188
02:28:15,065 --> 02:28:16,775
That's why mama,
I went to hit him!

2189
02:28:18,855 --> 02:28:21,025
Hey... You took a gang and went!

2190
02:28:23,605 --> 02:28:24,485
Go alone!

2191
02:28:24,485 --> 02:28:25,355
Aiyo! Lord Shiva!

2192
02:28:33,775 --> 02:28:35,315
Hello...

2193
02:28:35,405 --> 02:28:36,235
Sir...

2194
02:28:36,355 --> 02:28:37,065
Tell Kulkarni...

2195
02:28:37,065 --> 02:28:38,155
He killed him sir...

2196
02:28:38,155 --> 02:28:39,195
What did you say,

2197
02:28:39,235 --> 02:28:40,155
Tell me again...

2198
02:28:40,235 --> 02:28:42,985
He has killed Garuda sir...

2199
02:28:49,445 --> 02:28:52,195
Everyone came know about Garuda's death!

2200
02:28:56,235 --> 02:28:59,355
Like Suryavardhan said...
The trumpets were waiting!

2201
02:29:01,405 --> 02:29:03,065
There is news from India...

2202
02:29:04,065 --> 02:29:06,355
The were waiting to destroy KGF...

2203
02:29:06,525 --> 02:29:08,565
Madam in KGF...

2204
02:29:10,985 --> 02:29:11,695
Brother,

2205
02:29:11,695 --> 02:29:12,655
Garuda died...

2206
02:29:14,355 --> 02:29:15,855
They were also waiting to reclaim it!

2207
02:29:16,065 --> 02:29:17,025
Adeera!

2208
02:29:17,065 --> 02:29:17,775
Brother...

2209
02:29:17,855 --> 02:29:21,155
Till Garuda was alive, I will not wish to desire this place...

2210
02:29:23,105 --> 02:29:28,105
My brother said that I did not know politics...

2211
02:29:31,605 --> 02:29:34,355
But the fact that another person's
footsteps had fallen there...

2212
02:29:36,275 --> 02:29:37,695
This nobody knew!

2213
02:29:43,695 --> 02:29:46,525
Powerful people come from powerful places...

2214
02:29:47,695 --> 02:29:51,655
When Andrews said he will give Bombay like giving a candy,

2215
02:29:51,775 --> 02:29:54,735
for Rocky the ocean also became just a well...

2216
02:29:59,485 --> 02:30:01,855
Thinking the ocean was elsewere, he went searching for it...

2217
02:30:01,855 --> 02:30:04,155
when he saw Garuda, It was confirmed to Rocky that

2218
02:30:04,355 --> 02:30:07,445
here is man who comes from that powerful place.

2219
02:30:07,945 --> 02:30:09,275
So, even though he got a chance,

2220
02:30:09,275 --> 02:30:10,695
he did not finish him.

2221
02:30:11,275 --> 02:30:12,065
He left him...

2222
02:30:14,855 --> 02:30:17,735
To obtain KGF, he needed an army,

2223
02:30:20,025 --> 02:30:21,235
That's why Rocky,

2224
02:30:21,355 --> 02:30:23,235
in front of everyone he killed Garuda

2225
02:30:23,655 --> 02:30:25,695
And injected courage to all those who witnessed it

2226
02:30:25,855 --> 02:30:27,855
and made them all his soldiers!

2227
02:30:31,485 --> 02:30:32,235
Hey...

2228
02:30:32,605 --> 02:30:34,105
What are you looking at?
Kill him!

2229
02:30:34,105 --> 02:30:38,485
If 400 people with guns were ready to kill as ordered by Vanaram,

2230
02:30:38,855 --> 02:30:41,695
20,000 people had mustered coyrage in their hearts

2231
02:30:41,695 --> 02:30:44,105
and were ready to die for Rocky!

2232
02:30:47,235 --> 02:30:50,985
If you draw courage from the thousand people standing behind you...

2233
02:30:52,605 --> 02:30:54,525
Then you can win only one battle!

2234
02:30:56,235 --> 02:30:58,355
But if the fact that you are leading them...

2235
02:30:58,355 --> 02:31:00,565
Makes those 1000 people behind you brave,

2236
02:31:02,855 --> 02:31:04,485
you can win the whole world!

2237
02:31:07,945 --> 02:31:09,235
Go...

2238
02:31:10,905 --> 02:31:11,815
Go alone!

2239
02:31:12,025 --> 02:31:16,815
He came...

2240
02:31:19,355 --> 02:31:21,695
This is still the first chapter...

2241
02:31:23,015 --> 02:31:23,985
The story...

2242
02:31:24,155 --> 02:31:25,605
I am enforcing the Army

2243
02:31:25,905 --> 02:31:27,135
And signing a Death Warrant

2244
02:31:27,135 --> 02:31:29,065
of the biggest criminal in India.

2245
02:31:31,015 --> 02:31:33,245
Now it is just the beginning...
