1
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,084
If I Didn't Care

2
00:00:34,164 --> 00:00:38,042
# If I didn't care

3
00:00:39,295 --> 00:00:43,548
# More than words can say

4
00:00:44,633 --> 00:00:48,803
# If I didn't care

5
00:00:50,014 --> 00:00:54,017
# Would I feel this way?

6
00:00:55,185 --> 00:00:59,231
# If this isn't love

7
00:01:00,984 --> 00:01:04,862
# Then why do I thrill?

8
00:01:06,281 --> 00:01:12,036
# And what makes my head
go round and round

9
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,915
# While my heart stands still?

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,628
# If I didn't care

11
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:25,549
# Would it be the same?

12
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:33,307
# Would my every prayer begin and end

13
00:01:33,391 --> 00:01:36,310
# With just your name?

14
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,190
# And would I be sure

15
00:01:41,274 --> 00:01:47,154
# That this is love beyond compare?

16
00:01:48,823 --> 00:01:50,866
# Would all this be true

17
00:01:52,285 --> 00:01:57,374
# If I didn't care for you?

18
00:02:15,393 --> 00:02:17,394
Mr. Dufresne,

19
00:02:17,478 --> 00:02:21,731
describe the confrontation you had
with your wife the night she was murdered.

20
00:02:26,362 --> 00:02:28,488
It was very bitter.

21
00:02:28,572 --> 00:02:32,992
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around...

22
00:02:34,412 --> 00:02:37,956
And she said she wanted a divorce in Reno.

23
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,874
What was your response?

24
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,918
I told her I would not grant one.

25
00:02:42,002 --> 00:02:45,046
"I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno."

26
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:48,800
Those were the words you used, Mr. Dufresne,
according to your neighbors.

27
00:02:49,927 --> 00:02:53,597
If they say so.
I really don't remember. I was upset.

28
00:02:54,725 --> 00:02:58,227
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

29
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,229
She packed a bag.

30
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:04,483
She packed a bag to go and stay with...
Mr. Quentin.

31
00:03:04,568 --> 00:03:06,861
Glenn Quentin.

32
00:03:06,945 --> 00:03:09,029
Golf pro at the Snowdon Hills Country Club.

33
00:03:09,114 --> 00:03:12,992
The man you discovered was your wife's lover.

34
00:03:14,745 --> 00:03:16,120
Did you follow her?

35
00:03:17,372 --> 00:03:19,540
I went to a few bars first.

36
00:03:19,624 --> 00:03:22,501
Later, I drove to his house to confront them.

37
00:03:22,586 --> 00:03:26,172
They weren't home, so I...parked in the turnout,

38
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:27,840
and waited.

39
00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:30,134
With what intention?

40
00:03:30,218 --> 00:03:32,011
I'm not sure.

41
00:03:32,095 --> 00:03:34,305
I was confused.

42
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:36,056
Drunk.

43
00:03:37,809 --> 00:03:40,811
I think...mostly, I wanted to scare them.

44
00:03:40,896 --> 00:03:44,148
When they arrived,
you went up to the house and murdered them.

45
00:03:44,232 --> 00:03:47,318
No. I was sobering up.

46
00:03:47,402 --> 00:03:50,154
I got back in the car,
and I drove home to sleep it off.

47
00:03:50,238 --> 00:03:53,700
Along the way, I stopped,
and I threw my gun into the Royal River.

48
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:55,994
I feel I've been very clear on this point.

49
00:03:56,078 --> 00:03:59,873
Well, where I get hazy is where the cleaning
woman shows up the following morning

50
00:03:59,957 --> 00:04:05,629
and finds your wife in bed with her lover,
riddled with.38 caliber bullets.

51
00:04:06,672 --> 00:04:10,926
Now, does that strike you as a fantastic
coincidence, Mr. Dufresne, or is it just me?

52
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,844
Yes, it does.

53
00:04:12,929 --> 00:04:19,017
Yet you still maintain that you threw your gun
into the river before the murders took place?

54
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:22,896
- That's very convenient.
- It's the truth.

55
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:27,692
The police dragged that river
for three days, and nary a gun was found.

56
00:04:27,777 --> 00:04:30,570
So, there could be no comparison made
between your gun

57
00:04:30,655 --> 00:04:34,825
and the bullets taken from
the bloodstained corpses of the victims.

58
00:04:36,118 --> 00:04:38,995
And that also...

59
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,081
is very convenient.

60
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:42,666
Isnâ€™t it, Mr. Dufresne?

61
00:04:43,876 --> 00:04:46,127
Since I am innocent of this crime, sir,

62
00:04:46,212 --> 00:04:49,799
I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

63
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:53,052
If I Didn't Care

64
00:04:56,974 --> 00:05:00,226
# And would I be sure that this

65
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,939
# Is love beyond compare...

66
00:05:08,485 --> 00:05:11,404
Ladies and gentlemen,
you've heard all the evidence.

67
00:05:11,488 --> 00:05:14,073
We have the accused at the scene of the crime.

68
00:05:14,157 --> 00:05:15,992
We have footprints, tire tracks,

69
00:05:16,076 --> 00:05:20,121
bullets strewn on the ground which bear
his fingerprints, a broken bourbon bottle,

70
00:05:20,205 --> 00:05:22,331
likewise with fingerprints.

71
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,083
And most of all,

72
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:26,460
we have a beautiful young woman and her lover

73
00:05:26,545 --> 00:05:28,629
lying dead in each other's arms.

74
00:05:30,716 --> 00:05:32,967
They had sinned.

75
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:38,598
But was their crime so great
as to merit a death sentence?

76
00:05:39,766 --> 00:05:41,851
Now, while you think about that...

77
00:05:43,562 --> 00:05:46,063
..think about this.

78
00:05:46,148 --> 00:05:48,692
A revolver holds six bullets.

79
00:05:48,776 --> 00:05:50,152
Not eight.

80
00:05:50,236 --> 00:05:53,697
I submit that this was not a hot-blooded
crime of passion.

81
00:05:53,781 --> 00:05:56,825
That could be understood, if not condoned.

82
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,536
No. This was revenge...

83
00:05:59,621 --> 00:06:04,124
of a much more brutal
and cold-blooded nature. Consider this.

84
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,752
Four bullets per victim.

85
00:06:06,836 --> 00:06:09,212
Not six shots fired, but eight.

86
00:06:09,297 --> 00:06:13,216
That means that he fired the gun empty,

87
00:06:13,301 --> 00:06:15,594
and then stopped to reload...

88
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:19,264
..so that he could shoot each of them again.

89
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:21,934
An extra bullet per lover.

90
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:24,061
Right in the head.

91
00:06:28,107 --> 00:06:33,028
You strike me as a particularly icy
and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

92
00:06:33,112 --> 00:06:35,364
It chills my blood just to look at you.

93
00:06:37,116 --> 00:06:40,077
By the power vested in me
by the state of Maine,

94
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:43,705
I hereby order you to serve two life sentences,
back to back.

95
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:47,418
One for each of your victims. So be it.

96
00:07:12,444 --> 00:07:14,112
Sit.

97
00:07:18,158 --> 00:07:21,077
We see by your file
you've served 20 years of a life sentence.

98
00:07:21,161 --> 00:07:22,745
Yes, sir.

99
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,289
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

100
00:07:25,374 --> 00:07:27,583
Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

101
00:07:29,211 --> 00:07:31,170
I mean, I learned my lesson.

102
00:07:32,256 --> 00:07:35,508
I can honestly say...I'm a changed man.

103
00:07:39,221 --> 00:07:41,556
I'm no longer a danger to society.

104
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,726
That's God's honest truth.

105
00:08:19,888 --> 00:08:22,681
Hey, Red. How'd it go?

106
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:25,392
Same old shit. Different day.

107
00:08:25,477 --> 00:08:29,104
Yeah. I know how you feel.
I'm up for rejection next week.

108
00:08:30,273 --> 00:08:32,858
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

109
00:08:32,942 --> 00:08:34,234
It happens.

110
00:08:34,319 --> 00:08:35,903
Hey, Red. Bump me a deck.

111
00:08:35,987 --> 00:08:39,364
Get the fuck out of my face, will you, man?
You've had five packs already.

112
00:08:39,449 --> 00:08:40,657
- Four.
- Five.

113
00:08:41,702 --> 00:08:45,246
There must be a con like me
in every prison in America.

114
00:08:45,331 --> 00:08:47,248
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

115
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,460
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer
- if that's your thing -

116
00:08:50,544 --> 00:08:54,130
a bottle of brandy
to celebrate your kid's high-school graduation.

117
00:08:54,215 --> 00:08:56,549
Damn near anything, within reason.

118
00:08:56,634 --> 00:08:58,927
Yes, sir. I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.

119
00:09:03,265 --> 00:09:06,643
So, when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949

120
00:09:06,727 --> 00:09:10,063
and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth
into the prison for him,

121
00:09:10,147 --> 00:09:12,232
I told him, "No problem."

122
00:09:54,317 --> 00:09:56,610
Andy came to Shawshank Prison

123
00:09:56,695 --> 00:10:00,823
in early 1947, for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging.

124
00:10:00,907 --> 00:10:05,202
On the outside he had been vice-president
of a large Portland bank.

125
00:10:05,287 --> 00:10:07,288
Good work for a man as young as he was.

126
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:14,336
Hey, Red.

127
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:54,044
Do you speak English, butt steak?
You follow this officer.

128
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:11,394
I haven't seen such a sorry-looking heap
of m-m-maggot shit in all my life.

129
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:13,563
Hey, fish! Come over here.

130
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:31,498
Come on, fish.

131
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:38,881
Taking bets today, Red?

132
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:40,967
Smokes or coins? Better's choice.

133
00:11:41,051 --> 00:11:42,843
Smokes. Put me down for two.

134
00:11:42,928 --> 00:11:44,971
All right. Who's your horse?

135
00:11:45,055 --> 00:11:48,349
That little sack of
shit...eighth from the front.

136
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:49,600
He'll be first.

137
00:11:49,685 --> 00:11:51,894
- Bullshit. I'll take that action.
- Me too.

138
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:54,230
You're out some smokes, son. Let me tell you.

139
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,232
Heywood, you're so smart, you call it.

140
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,818
I'll take...t-t-the chubby fat-ass there.

141
00:11:58,902 --> 00:12:02,280
The fifth one from the front.
Put me down for a quarter deck.

142
00:12:02,364 --> 00:12:05,241
Fresh fish!

143
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:09,412
Fresh fish today! We're reeling them in!

144
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:13,749
I must admit, I didn't think much of Andy,
first time I laid eyes on him.

145
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:17,336
Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over.

146
00:12:17,421 --> 00:12:19,714
That was my first impression of the man.

147
00:12:19,798 --> 00:12:21,507
What do you say, Red?

148
00:12:21,591 --> 00:12:24,844
That tall drink of water
with the silver spoon up his ass.

149
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:27,096
That guy? Never happen.

150
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,306
Ten cigarettes.

151
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,557
That's a rich bet.

152
00:12:29,641 --> 00:12:31,851
All right. Who's gonna prove me wrong?

153
00:12:31,935 --> 00:12:34,021
Heywood? Jigger?

154
00:12:34,105 --> 00:12:35,564
Skeet?

155
00:12:35,648 --> 00:12:37,858
Floyd?

156
00:12:37,942 --> 00:12:40,068
Four brave souls.

157
00:12:40,153 --> 00:12:42,988
Return to your cell blocks for evening count.

158
00:12:43,072 --> 00:12:45,574
All prisoners return to your cell blocks.

159
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,764
Turn to the right. Eyes front.

160
00:13:22,195 --> 00:13:25,197
This is Mr. Hadley. He's Captain of the Guards.

161
00:13:25,281 --> 00:13:27,449
I'm Mr. Norton, the Warden.

162
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:30,035
You are convicted felons.

163
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:32,455
That's why they've sent you to me.

164
00:13:32,539 --> 00:13:34,165
Rule number one:

165
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:36,125
No blasphemy.

166
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:39,754
I'll not have the Lord's name taken in vain
in my prison.

167
00:13:39,838 --> 00:13:41,214
The other rules...

168
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:43,007
you'll figure out as you go along.

169
00:13:43,092 --> 00:13:44,884
Any questions?

170
00:13:44,968 --> 00:13:46,177
When do we eat?

171
00:13:54,686 --> 00:13:56,854
You eat when we say you eat!

172
00:13:56,939 --> 00:14:00,316
You shit when we say you shit,
and you piss when we say you piss.

173
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:03,277
You got that, you maggot-dick motherfucker?

174
00:14:03,362 --> 00:14:04,654
Aarghh!

175
00:14:04,738 --> 00:14:06,697
On your feet.

176
00:14:06,782 --> 00:14:08,574
I believe in two things.

177
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:11,536
Discipline and the Bible.

178
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,454
Here you'll receive both.

179
00:14:14,581 --> 00:14:17,208
Put your trust in the Lord.

180
00:14:17,292 --> 00:14:19,168
Your ass belongs to me.

181
00:14:21,255 --> 00:14:23,339
Welcome to Shawshank.

182
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,888
Unhook 'em.

183
00:14:35,145 --> 00:14:37,020
Turn around.

184
00:14:43,445 --> 00:14:45,779
That's enough.

185
00:14:45,864 --> 00:14:48,615
Move to the end of the cage.

186
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,075
Turn around.

187
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,410
Delouse him.

188
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,496
Turn around.

189
00:14:57,083 --> 00:15:00,252
Move out of the cage, go left.
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

190
00:15:00,336 --> 00:15:01,879
Next man up.

191
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:07,176
To the right. Right, right, right.

192
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,802
Left, left...

193
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:13,056
The first night's the toughest.
No doubt about it.

194
00:15:13,141 --> 00:15:16,268
They march you in,
naked as the day you were born,

195
00:15:16,352 --> 00:15:20,439
skin burning and half-blind
from that delousing shit they throw on you.

196
00:15:20,523 --> 00:15:23,484
And when they put you in that cell,

197
00:15:23,568 --> 00:15:26,236
and those bars slam home...

198
00:15:26,321 --> 00:15:29,073
that's when you know it's for real.

199
00:15:29,158 --> 00:15:32,494
Old life blown away in the blink of an eye.

200
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:33,786
Nothing left,

201
00:15:33,871 --> 00:15:36,581
but all the time in the world to think about it.

202
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:41,586
Most new fish come close to madness
the first night.

203
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,964
Somebody always breaks down crying.

204
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:47,509
Happens every time.

205
00:15:47,593 --> 00:15:49,677
The only question is:

206
00:15:49,762 --> 00:15:51,179
Who's it gonna be?

207
00:15:52,264 --> 00:15:54,849
It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess.

208
00:15:56,769 --> 00:15:58,853
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

209
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:10,114
Lights out!

210
00:16:30,637 --> 00:16:33,722
I remember my first night.

211
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:35,891
Seems like a long time ago.

212
00:16:37,435 --> 00:16:39,895
Yoo-hoo!

213
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,481
Hey, fish.

214
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:45,609
Fish, fish, fish, fish, fishy.

215
00:16:45,694 --> 00:16:49,613
- Boy, are you scared of the dark?
- You like it here, new fish?

216
00:16:49,698 --> 00:16:52,032
You'll wish
your daddy never dicked your mommy.

217
00:16:52,117 --> 00:16:56,120
Fishy! Oh, I want me a pork chop. Oh, yes!

218
00:16:56,204 --> 00:17:01,250
You taking this down, new fish?
There's gonna be a quiz later!

219
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:04,712
- Poke your ass out, give me a first look!
- Shh! Keep it down.

220
00:17:04,796 --> 00:17:08,132
The boys always go fishing
with first-timers.

221
00:17:08,216 --> 00:17:10,259
They don't quit till they reel someone in.

222
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:15,431
Hey, Fat Ass.

223
00:17:15,515 --> 00:17:17,182
Fat Ass.

224
00:17:18,393 --> 00:17:20,853
Talk to me, boy.

225
00:17:20,937 --> 00:17:23,647
I know you're there. I can hear you breathing.

226
00:17:23,732 --> 00:17:26,651
Don't you listen to these nitwits.
You hear me?

227
00:17:26,736 --> 00:17:28,820
This place ain't so bad.

228
00:17:28,904 --> 00:17:30,530
I tell you what.

229
00:17:31,699 --> 00:17:34,868
I'll introduce you around.
Make you feel right at home.

230
00:17:34,952 --> 00:17:37,537
I know a couple of big old bull queers

231
00:17:37,622 --> 00:17:40,582
that would just love to make your acquaintance.

232
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:44,085
Especially that big, white,
m- mushy butt of yours.

233
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,087
God!

234
00:17:46,172 --> 00:17:47,672
I don't belong here!

235
00:17:47,757 --> 00:17:49,174
We have a winner!

236
00:17:49,258 --> 00:17:51,009
I wanna go home!

237
00:17:51,093 --> 00:17:52,927
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

238
00:17:53,012 --> 00:17:56,181
Hey, it's the fat guy! It's the fat guy!

239
00:17:56,265 --> 00:18:00,101
Fresh fish! Fresh fish! Fresh fish!

240
00:18:00,186 --> 00:18:02,896
I don't belong here!

241
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,189
Fresh fish!

242
00:18:04,273 --> 00:18:07,609
I wanna go home. I want my mommy.

243
00:18:07,693 --> 00:18:10,695
I had your mother. She wasn't that great.

244
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,280
Fresh fish!

245
00:18:14,116 --> 00:18:16,910
What the Christ is this happy horse shit?

246
00:18:16,994 --> 00:18:19,704
He took the Lord's name in vain.
I'm telling the Warden.

247
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:21,289
With my baton up your ass!

248
00:18:21,374 --> 00:18:23,042
Let me out of here!

249
00:18:23,126 --> 00:18:26,504
What is your malfunction,
you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

250
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:27,755
Please...

251
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,882
I ain't supposed to be here.

252
00:18:29,966 --> 00:18:31,342
Not me!

253
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:33,886
I ain't gonna count to three, or even one.

254
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,263
Shut the fuck up, or I'll sing you a lullaby!

255
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,182
Shut up, man. Shut up.

256
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:39,558
There's been a mistake!

257
00:18:39,643 --> 00:18:42,812
You don't understand.
I'm not supposed to be here!

258
00:18:42,896 --> 00:18:43,979
Open that cell.

259
00:18:44,064 --> 00:18:48,234
Me neither.
You people run this place like a fucking prison!

260
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,743
Son of a bitch.

261
00:19:01,915 --> 00:19:03,999
Take it easy.

262
00:19:26,774 --> 00:19:30,152
If I hear so much as a mouse fart in here
the rest of the night,

263
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:33,905
I swear by God and sonny Jesus,
you will all visit the infirmary.

264
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,074
Every last motherfucker in here.

265
00:19:39,996 --> 00:19:43,665
Call the trustees.
Take that tub of shit down to the infirmary.

266
00:19:57,972 --> 00:20:02,684
His first night in the joint,
Andy Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes.

267
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:05,645
He never made a sound.

268
00:20:21,163 --> 00:20:24,415
Tier 3 North. Clear.

269
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,667
Tier 2 South. Clear.

270
00:20:26,752 --> 00:20:28,628
Tier 3 South. Clear.

271
00:20:28,712 --> 00:20:30,671
Tier 1 North...

272
00:20:30,756 --> 00:20:33,549
- Tier 1 South. Clear.
- Tier 4 South. Clear.

273
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:35,718
Prepare to roll out.

274
00:20:39,097 --> 00:20:41,182
Roll out!

275
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:36,864
Are... Are you going to eat that?

276
00:21:36,948 --> 00:21:39,867
I hadn't... I hadn't planned on it.

277
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:42,160
Do you mind?

278
00:21:49,502 --> 00:21:52,129
Ah...that's nice and ripe.

279
00:22:03,725 --> 00:22:06,184
Jake says thank you.

280
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:08,687
Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop.

281
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,486
I'm going to look after him
until he's big enough to fly.

282
00:22:15,571 --> 00:22:17,363
Oh, no, no. Here he comes.

283
00:22:20,492 --> 00:22:24,412
Morning, fellas. Fine morning, ain't it?

284
00:22:24,496 --> 00:22:26,915
You know why it's a fine morning, don't you?

285
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:29,417
Come on. Set 'em down.
I want 'em all lined up here,

286
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:32,295
just like a pretty little chorus line.

287
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:34,464
Yeah, look at that!

288
00:22:34,548 --> 00:22:37,425
- Look at that. Oh, Lord!
- I can't stand this guy.

289
00:22:38,636 --> 00:22:41,304
Yes. Richmond, Virginia.

290
00:22:41,388 --> 00:22:43,473
- Smell my ass!
- After he smells mine.

291
00:22:43,557 --> 00:22:48,895
Gee, Red, it was a terrible shame
about your horse coming in last, an' all.

292
00:22:48,979 --> 00:22:52,190
But I sure do love that winning horse of mine,
though.

293
00:22:52,274 --> 00:22:54,984
I owe that boy a great big, sloppy kiss
when I see him.

294
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:58,071
Why don't you give him some of your cigarettes,
instead?

295
00:22:58,155 --> 00:22:59,948
Lucky fuck.

296
00:23:00,032 --> 00:23:01,741
Hey, Tyrell.

297
00:23:01,825 --> 00:23:04,786
You pull infirmary duty this week?

298
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,579
How's that horse of mine doing?

299
00:23:06,664 --> 00:23:08,122
Dead.

300
00:23:08,207 --> 00:23:13,587
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.
The doc had already gone home for the night.

301
00:23:13,588 --> 00:23:16,340
Poor bastard lay there till this morning.

302
00:23:16,424 --> 00:23:19,259
By then, hell, there
weren't nothing we could do.

303
00:23:25,058 --> 00:23:26,642
What was his name?

304
00:23:29,896 --> 00:23:31,271
What did you say?

305
00:23:33,149 --> 00:23:35,526
I was just wondering if anyone knew his name.

306
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:38,320
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

307
00:23:39,781 --> 00:23:43,158
It doesn't fuckin' matter what his name was.
He's dead.

308
00:24:02,512 --> 00:24:04,847
Hey...

309
00:24:04,931 --> 00:24:07,683
Anybody come at you yet?

310
00:24:09,185 --> 00:24:11,187
Anybody get to you yet?

311
00:24:12,314 --> 00:24:15,358
Hey, we all need friends in here.

312
00:24:15,443 --> 00:24:17,360
I could be a friend to you.

313
00:24:19,822 --> 00:24:21,489
Hey...

314
00:24:26,328 --> 00:24:28,204
Hard to get.

315
00:24:29,874 --> 00:24:31,541
I like that.

316
00:24:38,174 --> 00:24:41,468
Andy kept pretty much to himself at first.

317
00:24:41,552 --> 00:24:44,012
I guess he had a lot on his mind,

318
00:24:44,096 --> 00:24:46,306
trying to adapt to life on the inside.

319
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:50,560
It wasn't until a month went by
that he opened his mouth

320
00:24:50,644 --> 00:24:52,937
to say more than two words to somebody.

321
00:24:54,857 --> 00:24:56,900
As it turned out...

322
00:24:56,984 --> 00:24:58,902
that somebody was me.

323
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:06,659
Officers Russell and Burwell
report to the duty officer.

324
00:25:07,703 --> 00:25:10,456
I'm Andy Dufresne.

325
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,625
The wife-killing banker.

326
00:25:14,461 --> 00:25:16,170
Why did you do it?

327
00:25:16,254 --> 00:25:17,880
I didn't, since you ask.

328
00:25:17,964 --> 00:25:21,008
You're gonna fit right in!

329
00:25:21,093 --> 00:25:24,261
Everybody in here's innocent.
Didn't you know that?

330
00:25:24,346 --> 00:25:27,681
- Heywood, what are you in here for?
- Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

331
00:25:30,602 --> 00:25:33,395
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

332
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,233
You think your shit smells sweeter than most.
Is that right?

333
00:25:37,317 --> 00:25:39,652
- What do you think?
- To tell you the truth,

334
00:25:39,736 --> 00:25:42,822
I haven't made up my mind.

335
00:25:42,906 --> 00:25:46,992
I understand
you're a man that knows how to get things.

336
00:25:47,077 --> 00:25:50,579
I'm known to locate certain things,
from time to time.

337
00:25:50,664 --> 00:25:53,666
- I wonder if you might get me a rock hammer.
- A what?

338
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,126
A rock hammer.

339
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:57,503
- What is it, and why?
- What do you care?

340
00:25:59,381 --> 00:26:02,258
Well, if it was a toothbrush,
I'd just quote a price,

341
00:26:02,342 --> 00:26:04,927
but then a toothbrush is a non-lethal object.

342
00:26:06,346 --> 00:26:08,056
Fair enough.

343
00:26:08,141 --> 00:26:10,600
A rock hammer
is about six or seven inches long.

344
00:26:10,685 --> 00:26:12,310
Looks like a miniature pickaxe.

345
00:26:12,395 --> 00:26:13,520
Pickaxe?

346
00:26:13,604 --> 00:26:15,689
- For rocks.
- Rocks.

347
00:26:17,358 --> 00:26:19,526
Quartz?

348
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,278
Quartz.

349
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,906
And some mica.

350
00:26:24,991 --> 00:26:26,158
Shale.

351
00:26:27,243 --> 00:26:28,827
Limestone.

352
00:26:28,911 --> 00:26:30,829
So?

353
00:26:30,913 --> 00:26:32,998
So, I'm a rock hound.

354
00:26:33,082 --> 00:26:36,293
At least, I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again on a limited basis.

355
00:26:36,377 --> 00:26:38,503
Or maybe you want
to hammer somebody's skull.

356
00:26:38,588 --> 00:26:40,046
No, sir.

357
00:26:41,174 --> 00:26:42,757
I have no enemies here.

358
00:26:42,842 --> 00:26:45,218
No? Wait a while.

359
00:26:46,762 --> 00:26:48,930
Word gets around.

360
00:26:49,015 --> 00:26:52,142
The Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.

361
00:26:52,226 --> 00:26:54,019
Especially Bogs.

362
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:59,316
I don't suppose it would help any
if I explained to them I'm not homosexual.

363
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,901
Neither are they.

364
00:27:00,985 --> 00:27:03,695
You have to be human first. They don't qualify.

365
00:27:08,952 --> 00:27:13,497
Bull queers take by force.
It's all they want or understand.

366
00:27:13,582 --> 00:27:17,210
If I were you,
I'd grow eyes in the back of my head.

367
00:27:17,294 --> 00:27:18,628
Thanks for the advice.

368
00:27:18,712 --> 00:27:20,296
Well, that's free.

369
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,632
You understand my concern.

370
00:27:22,716 --> 00:27:25,259
Well, if there's any trouble,
I won't use the hammer.

371
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:29,555
Then I guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

372
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,808
Did I miss something? What's funny?

373
00:27:32,893 --> 00:27:35,937
You'll understand
when you see the rock hammer.

374
00:27:37,814 --> 00:27:39,815
What's an item like this usually go for?

375
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,944
Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.

376
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:45,738
My normal mark-up's 20 per cent.

377
00:27:45,739 --> 00:27:48,282
But this is a specialty item.

378
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:50,952
The risk goes up, the price goes up.

379
00:27:50,953 --> 00:27:52,912
Let's make it an even ten bucks.

380
00:27:52,996 --> 00:27:54,872
Ten it is.

381
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:58,376
Waste of money, if you ask me.

382
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,002
Why's that?

383
00:28:01,088 --> 00:28:04,132
Folks around this joint
love surprise inspections.

384
00:28:05,718 --> 00:28:08,011
If they find it, you're gonna lose it.

385
00:28:08,096 --> 00:28:10,222
If they do catch you with it, you don't know me.

386
00:28:10,306 --> 00:28:12,516
Mention my name, we never do business again.

387
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,727
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now, you got that?

388
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,647
I understand.

389
00:28:18,731 --> 00:28:20,148
Thank you...

390
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:21,775
Mr. er...?

391
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:24,319
Red. The name's Red.

392
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,362
Red?

393
00:28:25,446 --> 00:28:28,198
Why do they call you that?

394
00:28:31,869 --> 00:28:33,954
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

395
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:44,965
I could see
why some of the boys took him for snobby.

396
00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:48,468
He had a quiet way about him.

397
00:28:48,553 --> 00:28:53,015
A walk and a talk
that just wasn't normal around here.

398
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:54,641
He strolled...

399
00:28:54,726 --> 00:28:59,062
like a man in a park,
without a care or worry in the world.

400
00:28:59,147 --> 00:29:03,860
Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.

401
00:29:03,944 --> 00:29:08,114
Yeah. I think it would be fair to say...

402
00:29:08,115 --> 00:29:10,199
I liked Andy from the start.

403
00:29:11,952 --> 00:29:15,163
Let's go!
Some of us have got a schedule to keep.

404
00:29:18,459 --> 00:29:20,543
Move it! Come on. Move it!

405
00:29:24,173 --> 00:29:27,300
Bob, how are you doing?
How's the wife treating you?

406
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:38,478
Easy.

407
00:29:38,562 --> 00:29:40,646
Keep it moving.

408
00:29:43,442 --> 00:29:44,692
Red...

409
00:30:05,215 --> 00:30:09,426
Andy was right. I finally got the joke.

410
00:30:09,511 --> 00:30:14,014
It would take a man about 600 years
to tunnel under the wall with one of these.

411
00:30:18,353 --> 00:30:19,478
Book?

412
00:30:19,562 --> 00:30:21,438
Not today.

413
00:30:26,778 --> 00:30:28,862
- Book?
- No.

414
00:30:30,657 --> 00:30:31,865
Hey, Brooksy.

415
00:30:35,161 --> 00:30:37,246
Delivery for Dufresne.

416
00:30:44,337 --> 00:30:49,967
Book?

417
00:30:52,971 --> 00:30:55,097
Dufresne...

418
00:30:55,181 --> 00:30:57,350
Here's your book.

419
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:03,440
Thanks.

420
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:10,488
Dufresne! We're running low on Hexlite.

421
00:31:10,573 --> 00:31:12,657
Get on back and fetch us up some.

422
00:31:49,862 --> 00:31:51,821
If you get this in your eyes, it blinds you.

423
00:31:51,906 --> 00:31:54,657
Honey...hush.

424
00:32:06,713 --> 00:32:09,131
That's it. You fight.

425
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,799
It's better that way.

426
00:32:19,226 --> 00:32:22,061
I wish I could tell you
that Andy fought the good fight,

427
00:32:22,145 --> 00:32:24,688
and the Sisters let him be.

428
00:32:24,773 --> 00:32:26,774
I wish I could tell you that.

429
00:32:26,858 --> 00:32:28,943
But prison is no fairy-tale world.

430
00:32:30,904 --> 00:32:33,030
He never said who did it.

431
00:32:33,114 --> 00:32:36,158
But we all knew.

432
00:32:39,496 --> 00:32:42,373
Things went on like that for a while.

433
00:32:42,457 --> 00:32:45,084
Prison life consists of routine...

434
00:32:45,168 --> 00:32:47,378
and then more routine.

435
00:32:49,756 --> 00:32:53,593
Every so often,
Andy would show up with fresh bruises.

436
00:32:54,762 --> 00:32:56,805
The Sisters kept at him.

437
00:32:56,889 --> 00:33:01,017
Sometimes he was able to fight 'em off.
Sometimes not.

438
00:33:01,102 --> 00:33:04,354
And that's how it went for Andy.

439
00:33:04,438 --> 00:33:06,982
That was his routine.

440
00:33:07,066 --> 00:33:10,860
I do believe
those first two years were the worst for him.

441
00:33:10,945 --> 00:33:13,196
And I also believe,

442
00:33:13,281 --> 00:33:17,826
if things had gone on that way,
this place would have got the best of him.

443
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:20,870
But then, in the spring of 1949,

444
00:33:20,955 --> 00:33:22,956
the powers that be decided that...

445
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,459
The roof of the license-plate factory
needs resurfacing.

446
00:33:26,544 --> 00:33:29,296
I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work.

447
00:33:30,464 --> 00:33:32,591
As you know,

448
00:33:32,675 --> 00:33:36,386
special detail carries
with it special privileges.

449
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:38,555
It was outdoor detail...

450
00:33:40,057 --> 00:33:43,643
..and May is one damn fine month
to be working outdoors.

451
00:33:43,728 --> 00:33:45,353
Stay in line there.

452
00:33:45,438 --> 00:33:48,356
More than a hundred men
volunteered for the job.

453
00:33:52,738 --> 00:33:55,031
Wallace E Unger.

454
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:58,659
Ellis Redding.

455
00:33:58,744 --> 00:34:01,579
Wouldn't you know it?

456
00:34:01,663 --> 00:34:04,248
Me and some fellows I know
were among the names.

457
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,417
Andrew Dufresne.

458
00:34:06,501 --> 00:34:10,046
It only cost us a pack of smokes per man.

459
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:12,840
I made my usual 20 per cent, of course.

460
00:34:12,924 --> 00:34:16,510
So, this big-shot lawyer
calls me long-distance from Texas.

461
00:34:16,595 --> 00:34:18,304
I say, "Yeah?"

462
00:34:18,388 --> 00:34:22,099
He says, "Sorry to inform you,
but your brother just died."

463
00:34:22,184 --> 00:34:24,685
Oh, damn, Byron. I'm sorry to hear that.

464
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,145
I'm not. He was an asshole.

465
00:34:26,229 --> 00:34:28,564
Ran off years ago.
Figured him for dead, anyway.

466
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:32,610
So, anyway, this lawyer fella says to me,
"Your brother died a rich man."

467
00:34:32,694 --> 00:34:35,404
Oil wells and shit. Close to a million bucks.

468
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:37,948
A million bucks?

469
00:34:38,033 --> 00:34:40,409
Fucking incredible
how lucky some assholes get.

470
00:34:40,494 --> 00:34:43,037
Jeez-Louise! Are you gonna see any of that?

471
00:34:43,121 --> 00:34:46,207
35,000. That's what he left me.

472
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:48,209
- Dollars?
- Yeah.

473
00:34:48,293 --> 00:34:51,421
Holy shit! That's great.
That's like winning the sweepstakes.

474
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,714
Isnâ€™t it?

475
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,842
Dumb shit. What do you think
the government's gonna do to me?

476
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,470
Take a big, wet bite out of my ass, is what.

477
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:02,641
Poor Byron! Terrible fucking luck, huh?

478
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:05,394
Crying shame.

479
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,145
Some people really got it awful!

480
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,772
Andy, are you nuts?

481
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,982
Keep your eyes on your mop, man. Andy!

482
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:14,027
Well, you'll pay some tax,
but you'll still end up...

483
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,947
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Maybe enough to buy a new car. Then what?

484
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,408
I've got to pay tax on the car.

485
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:23,370
Repair, maintenance, goddamn kids
pestering me to take them for a ride...

486
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:27,374
And at the end of the year, you figure the tax
wrong, you pay them out of your own pocket.

487
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,626
I tell you...Uncle Sam!

488
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:33,463
He puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

489
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,258
- Andy! Andy!
- What's he doing?

490
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,677
- Getting himself killed.
- Keep tarring.

491
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:41,847
Some brother! Shit.

492
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:42,973
Hey!

493
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,521
Mr. Hadley...

494
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:49,981
do you trust your wife?

495
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:53,276
Oh, that's funny.

496
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,237
You're gonna look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

497
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:59,782
I mean, do you think
she'd go behind your back, try to hamstring you?

498
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:02,744
That's it. Step aside, Mert.

499
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,328
This fucker's having an accident.

500
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:05,580
He's gonna push him off.

501
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:09,792
Cos if you do trust her,
there's no reason you can't keep that 35,000.

502
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:11,753
- What did you say?
- 35,000.

503
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:13,546
- 35,000?
- All of it.

504
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:15,882
- All of it?
- Every penny.

505
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:17,800
You'd better start making sense.

506
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:20,219
If you want to keep the money,
give it to your wife.

507
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:24,432
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $60,000.

508
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,058
Bullshit! Tax-free?

509
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:29,228
Tax-free. The IRS can't touch one cent.

510
00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:31,898
You're the smart banker what killed his wife.

511
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:35,526
Why should I believe a smart banker like you?
So I can end up in here with you?

512
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:37,111
It's legal. Ask the IRS.

513
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:40,406
They'll say the same thing.
But I feel stupid telling you this.

514
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:42,784
I'm sure you would have investigated the matter.

515
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:46,955
Yeah, I don't need no banker to tell me
where the bears shit in the buckwheat.

516
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,083
Of course not, but you do need someone
to set up the tax-free gift.

517
00:36:50,168 --> 00:36:52,044
It'll cost you. A lawyer.

518
00:36:52,128 --> 00:36:54,463
A bunch of ball-washing bastards.

519
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:58,383
I suppose I could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

520
00:36:58,384 --> 00:37:00,761
If you get the forms, I'll prepare them for you.

521
00:37:00,845 --> 00:37:02,721
Nearly free of charge.

522
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:07,184
I'd only ask three beers apiece
for each of my co-workers.

523
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:09,686
Co-workers! Get him! That's rich, ain't it?

524
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:13,232
I think a man working outdoors
feels more like a man

525
00:37:13,316 --> 00:37:15,067
if he can have a bottle of suds.

526
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:18,195
That's only my opinion...sir.

527
00:37:21,616 --> 00:37:23,158
What are you jimmies staring at?

528
00:37:23,243 --> 00:37:24,243
Back to work!

529
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:26,286
Let's go. Work.

530
00:37:34,671 --> 00:37:40,175
And that's how it came to pass...
that on the second-to-last day of the job,

531
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:44,931
the convict crew that tarred the
plate-factory roof in the spring of '49...

532
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:48,226
wound up sitting in a row
at ten o'clock in the morning,

533
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:52,188
drinking icy-cold, Bohemia-style beer...

534
00:37:52,273 --> 00:37:57,485
courtesy of the hardest screw that ever
walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.

535
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,654
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

536
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:05,201
The colossal prick
even managed to sound magnanimous.

537
00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:11,583
We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders,
and felt like free men.

538
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:15,169
Hell, we could have been tarring the roof
of one of our own houses.

539
00:38:15,254 --> 00:38:18,548
We were the lords of all creation.

540
00:38:18,632 --> 00:38:23,177
As for Andy,
he spent that break hunkered in the shade...

541
00:38:23,262 --> 00:38:25,972
a strange little smile on his face,

542
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:28,141
watching us drink his beer.

543
00:38:34,899 --> 00:38:36,441
Hey...

544
00:38:36,525 --> 00:38:37,817
Want a cold one, Andy?

545
00:38:37,902 --> 00:38:39,569
No, thanks.

546
00:38:39,653 --> 00:38:41,446
I gave up drinking.

547
00:38:45,285 --> 00:38:48,454
You could argue
he'd done it to curry favor with the guards.

548
00:38:48,538 --> 00:38:51,373
Or maybe make a few friends among us cons.

549
00:38:53,627 --> 00:38:57,087
Me, I think he did it just to feel normal again.

550
00:38:58,173 --> 00:39:00,257
If only for a short while.

551
00:39:03,136 --> 00:39:05,471
King me.

552
00:39:05,555 --> 00:39:07,973
Chess. Now, there's a game of kings.

553
00:39:08,058 --> 00:39:10,601
- What?
- Civilized, strategic.

554
00:39:10,685 --> 00:39:13,020
And a total fucking mystery.

555
00:39:13,104 --> 00:39:14,313
I hate it.

556
00:39:14,397 --> 00:39:16,315
Maybe you'll let me teach you someday.

557
00:39:16,399 --> 00:39:18,859
Yeah. Sure.

558
00:39:18,944 --> 00:39:21,070
I thought of getting a board together.

559
00:39:21,154 --> 00:39:23,948
Well, I'm the right man.
I'm the guy that can get things.

560
00:39:24,032 --> 00:39:25,532
We might do business on a board.

561
00:39:25,617 --> 00:39:28,410
But I want to carve the pieces myself.

562
00:39:28,495 --> 00:39:32,081
One side in alabaster, the opposing side
in soapstone. What do you think?

563
00:39:32,165 --> 00:39:34,083
I think it'll take years.

564
00:39:34,167 --> 00:39:36,752
Well, years I got.
What I don't have are the rocks.

565
00:39:36,836 --> 00:39:39,004
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

566
00:39:39,089 --> 00:39:41,049
Pebbles, mostly.

567
00:39:45,388 --> 00:39:48,264
Andy, we're getting to be kinda friends,
aren't we?

568
00:39:48,349 --> 00:39:50,016
Yeah, I guess.

569
00:39:51,143 --> 00:39:53,561
Can I ask you something?

570
00:39:53,646 --> 00:39:55,647
Why did you do it?

571
00:39:56,857 --> 00:40:00,735
I'm innocent, Red. Just
like everybody else here.

572
00:40:05,032 --> 00:40:07,117
What are you in for?

573
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,120
Murder.

574
00:40:10,204 --> 00:40:11,621
Same as you.

575
00:40:11,706 --> 00:40:12,872
Innocent?

576
00:40:15,543 --> 00:40:17,627
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

577
00:41:17,105 --> 00:41:18,689
Where's the canary?

578
00:41:18,774 --> 00:41:20,107
How did you know?

579
00:41:20,108 --> 00:41:21,275
How did I know what?

580
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,778
So, you don't know? Come.

581
00:41:26,531 --> 00:41:28,657
This is where the canary is, Johnny.

582
00:41:31,036 --> 00:41:35,039
Quite a surprise to hear a woman singing
in my house, eh, Johnny?

583
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,337
That's quite a...

584
00:41:40,421 --> 00:41:42,089
surprise.

585
00:41:44,592 --> 00:41:46,301
Red...

586
00:41:46,385 --> 00:41:48,178
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

587
00:41:48,262 --> 00:41:50,097
Here she comes.

588
00:41:50,181 --> 00:41:53,058
This is the part I like -
when she does that shit with her hair.

589
00:41:53,142 --> 00:41:56,061
Yeah, I know. I've seen
it three times this month.

590
00:41:56,145 --> 00:41:58,146
Gilda, are you decent?

591
00:41:58,231 --> 00:42:00,273
Me?

592
00:42:01,984 --> 00:42:04,027
Hah! God, I love it!

593
00:42:09,909 --> 00:42:13,703
I understand
you're a man that knows how to get things.

594
00:42:13,788 --> 00:42:17,666
Yeah, I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time. What do you want?

595
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:20,252
- Rita Hayworth.
- What?

596
00:42:20,336 --> 00:42:22,170
Can you get her?

597
00:42:23,256 --> 00:42:26,716
So, this is Johnny Farrell.
I've heard a lot about you, Johnny.

598
00:42:26,801 --> 00:42:28,677
Take a few weeks.

599
00:42:28,761 --> 00:42:29,970
Weeks?

600
00:42:29,971 --> 00:42:32,598
Well, yeah, Andy. I don't
have her stuffed down the

601
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:35,226
front of my pants right now, I'm sorry to say.

602
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:37,812
But I'll get her. Relax.

603
00:42:40,065 --> 00:42:41,566
Thanks.

604
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:43,651
- It was a surprise, Mr. Farrell.
- It was.

605
00:42:43,735 --> 00:42:44,777
Sit down.

606
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,779
Did you tell him what I'm doing here?

607
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:49,699
No, I wanted to save that as a surprise, too.

608
00:42:49,783 --> 00:42:51,450
Hang on to your hat, Mr. Farrell...

609
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:03,796
- Take a walk.
- I gotta change the reel.

610
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:05,965
I said fuck off!

611
00:43:10,804 --> 00:43:13,598
Ain't you gonna scream?

612
00:43:14,975 --> 00:43:16,767
Let's get this over with.

613
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:22,523
He broke my fuckin' nose!

614
00:43:33,036 --> 00:43:37,080
Now...I'm gonna open my fly...

615
00:43:37,165 --> 00:43:40,125
and you're gonna swallow
what I give you to swallow.

616
00:43:41,211 --> 00:43:43,003
Then you're gonna swallow Rooster's.

617
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:45,923
You broke his nose,
he ought to have something to show for it.

618
00:43:46,007 --> 00:43:48,217
Anything you put in my mouth,
you're gonna lose.

619
00:43:48,301 --> 00:43:51,053
No. You don't understand.

620
00:43:51,137 --> 00:43:54,431
You do that, and I'll put
all eight inches of this steel in your ear.

621
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:55,515
All right.

622
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:00,229
But you should know that sudden, serious brain
injury causes the victim to bite down hard.

623
00:44:01,481 --> 00:44:03,899
In fact, I hear the bite reflex is so strong,

624
00:44:03,983 --> 00:44:08,779
they have to pry the victim's jaws open...
with a crowbar.

625
00:44:11,616 --> 00:44:13,242
Where did you get this shit?

626
00:44:13,326 --> 00:44:14,993
I read it.

627
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,956
Know how to read, you ignorant fuck?

628
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:22,334
Honey...

629
00:44:23,586 --> 00:44:25,963
..you shouldn't.

630
00:44:28,007 --> 00:44:31,010
Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth...

631
00:44:31,095 --> 00:44:33,471
and neither did his friends.

632
00:44:33,555 --> 00:44:36,849
What they did do...
is beat him within an inch of his life.

633
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,061
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

634
00:44:41,105 --> 00:44:43,606
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

635
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:49,696
Time's up, Bogs.

636
00:44:53,367 --> 00:44:55,451
It's your world, boss.

637
00:44:57,538 --> 00:45:00,957
Return to your cell blocks for evening count.

638
00:45:01,041 --> 00:45:03,209
All prisoners report for lockdown.

639
00:45:18,767 --> 00:45:20,059
What?

640
00:45:32,532 --> 00:45:35,242
Where's he going?
Grab his ankles.

641
00:45:36,828 --> 00:45:39,330
No! No!

642
00:45:39,414 --> 00:45:40,789
No!

643
00:45:40,874 --> 00:45:42,207
Help me...

644
00:45:42,292 --> 00:45:43,584
Aaarghh!

645
00:45:45,879 --> 00:45:48,547
Two things never happened again after that.

646
00:45:48,631 --> 00:45:51,467
The Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again...

647
00:45:52,677 --> 00:45:55,387
..and Bogs never walked again.

648
00:45:56,514 --> 00:45:59,933
They transferred him
to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

649
00:46:00,018 --> 00:46:05,731
To my knowledge, he lived out the rest
of his days drinking his food through a straw.

650
00:46:05,815 --> 00:46:10,486
I'm thinking Andy could use a nice welcome
back when he gets out of the infirmary.

651
00:46:11,613 --> 00:46:15,407
Sounds good to us.
I figure we owe him that much for the beer.

652
00:46:16,785 --> 00:46:19,453
The man likes to play chess.

653
00:46:19,537 --> 00:46:21,622
Let's get him some rocks.

654
00:46:54,031 --> 00:46:55,907
Guys...

655
00:46:55,991 --> 00:46:58,368
I got one. I got one. Look.

656
00:47:00,788 --> 00:47:02,872
Heywood, that isn't soapstone.

657
00:47:02,957 --> 00:47:05,166
And it ain't alabaster, either.

658
00:47:05,251 --> 00:47:06,876
What are you, a fucking geologist?

659
00:47:06,961 --> 00:47:09,003
He's right. It ain't.

660
00:47:09,088 --> 00:47:10,338
Well, what the hell is it?

661
00:47:10,423 --> 00:47:12,966
A horse apple.

662
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:16,177
- Bullshit.
- No, horse shit. Petrified.

663
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,438
Oh, Jesus Christ!

664
00:47:25,522 --> 00:47:27,481
Oh, damn!

665
00:47:27,566 --> 00:47:31,527
Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.

666
00:47:32,737 --> 00:47:35,364
And by the weekend he was due back,
we had enough rocks

667
00:47:35,449 --> 00:47:38,492
to keep him busy till rapture.

668
00:47:38,577 --> 00:47:41,287
I also got a big shipment in that week.

669
00:47:41,371 --> 00:47:43,914
Cigarettes. Chewing gum.

670
00:47:43,999 --> 00:47:45,499
Sipping whisky.

671
00:47:45,584 --> 00:47:49,128
Playing cards with naked ladies on them.
You name it.

672
00:47:49,212 --> 00:47:52,173
And of course, the most important item.

673
00:47:53,925 --> 00:47:56,010
Rita Hayworth herself.

674
00:48:30,171 --> 00:48:33,006
OK, look alive! Open all tiers.

675
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:35,425
Heads up. They're tossing the cells.

676
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:37,761
Heads up. They're tossing the cells.

677
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:41,765
119.

678
00:48:43,267 --> 00:48:44,935
123.

679
00:48:54,403 --> 00:48:56,279
On your feet.

680
00:48:57,990 --> 00:48:59,866
Face the wall.

681
00:49:34,361 --> 00:49:36,445
Turn around and face the Warden.

682
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,245
Pleased to see you reading this.

683
00:49:45,622 --> 00:49:47,915
Any favorite passages?

684
00:49:48,959 --> 00:49:54,088
"Watch ye, therefore, for ye know not
when the master of the house cometh."

685
00:49:55,132 --> 00:49:58,009
Mark 13:35.

686
00:49:58,093 --> 00:50:00,761
I always liked that one.

687
00:50:00,846 --> 00:50:02,346
But I prefer...

688
00:50:02,431 --> 00:50:05,182
"I'm the light of the world.

689
00:50:05,267 --> 00:50:08,811
He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness,
but shall have the light of life."

690
00:50:08,895 --> 00:50:11,480
John, Chapter 8, Verse 12.

691
00:50:11,565 --> 00:50:15,026
I hear you're good with numbers. How nice.

692
00:50:16,153 --> 00:50:18,237
A man should have a skill.

693
00:50:20,325 --> 00:50:21,783
Wanna explain this?

694
00:50:22,869 --> 00:50:26,330
It's called a rock blanket.
It's for shaping and polishing rocks.

695
00:50:27,373 --> 00:50:29,333
A little hobby of mine.

696
00:50:40,178 --> 00:50:43,180
It's pretty clean. Some contraband here,

697
00:50:43,264 --> 00:50:45,349
but nothing to get in a twist over.

698
00:50:49,187 --> 00:50:51,271
I can't say I approve of this.

699
00:50:52,774 --> 00:50:54,483
But I suppose...

700
00:50:56,444 --> 00:50:58,320
..exceptions can be made.

701
00:51:08,706 --> 00:51:10,999
Lock 'em up!

702
00:51:13,002 --> 00:51:14,961
I almost forgot.

703
00:51:15,046 --> 00:51:17,298
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

704
00:51:17,383 --> 00:51:18,841
Salvation lies within.

705
00:51:19,927 --> 00:51:21,260
Yes, sir.

706
00:51:29,561 --> 00:51:32,146
Tossing cells was just an excuse.

707
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:36,275
The truth is, Norton wanted to size Andy up.

708
00:51:49,915 --> 00:51:53,042
My wife made that in church group.

709
00:51:55,379 --> 00:51:56,713
Very nice, sir.

710
00:51:57,881 --> 00:51:59,757
Do you enjoy working in the laundry?

711
00:52:01,385 --> 00:52:03,094
No, sir, not especially.

712
00:52:03,178 --> 00:52:05,972
Perhaps we can find something more...

713
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:08,141
befitting a man of your education.

714
00:52:16,484 --> 00:52:18,152
Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?

715
00:52:18,236 --> 00:52:19,528
Andy.

716
00:52:19,612 --> 00:52:21,905
I thought I heard you out here!

717
00:52:23,408 --> 00:52:24,992
I've been reassigned to you.

718
00:52:25,076 --> 00:52:28,245
I know. They told me.

719
00:52:28,329 --> 00:52:30,414
Ain't that a kick in the head?

720
00:52:30,498 --> 00:52:33,000
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

721
00:52:33,084 --> 00:52:35,169
Come on.

722
00:52:35,253 --> 00:52:37,421
Well, here she is.

723
00:52:37,505 --> 00:52:40,048
Shawshank Prison library.

724
00:52:40,133 --> 00:52:43,010
National Geographics.

725
00:52:43,094 --> 00:52:45,929
Reader's Digest condensed books.

726
00:52:46,014 --> 00:52:48,307
Louis L'Amour.

727
00:52:48,308 --> 00:52:50,434
Look Magazine.

728
00:52:50,518 --> 00:52:53,020
Erle Stanley Gardners.

729
00:52:53,104 --> 00:52:56,648
Every evening,
I load up the cart and make my round.

730
00:52:56,649 --> 00:52:59,818
I enter the names on this clipboard here.

731
00:52:59,903 --> 00:53:03,363
Easy-peasy, Japanesey. Any questions?

732
00:53:03,448 --> 00:53:06,408
Brooks, how long have you been librarian?

733
00:53:06,493 --> 00:53:11,663
Oh...I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1912.

734
00:53:11,748 --> 00:53:15,126
And in all that time,
have you ever had an assistant?

735
00:53:15,211 --> 00:53:17,796
No. No, not much to it, really.

736
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,798
Well, why me? Why now?

737
00:53:19,882 --> 00:53:21,382
I don't know,

738
00:53:21,467 --> 00:53:24,803
but it'll be nice to have some company
down here for a change.

739
00:53:24,804 --> 00:53:26,888
Dufresne!

740
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:38,274
That's him. That's the one.

741
00:53:45,825 --> 00:53:47,116
I'm Dekins.

742
00:53:47,201 --> 00:53:49,661
I was er...

743
00:53:49,745 --> 00:53:53,748
thinking about maybe setting up
some kind of trust fund for my kids' educations.

744
00:53:56,085 --> 00:53:57,544
Oh...

745
00:53:57,628 --> 00:53:59,295
I see.

746
00:54:00,756 --> 00:54:02,632
Well, erm...

747
00:54:04,009 --> 00:54:05,552
..why don't we have a seat,

748
00:54:05,636 --> 00:54:07,720
and talk it over?

749
00:54:10,266 --> 00:54:13,185
Brooks,
do you have a piece of paper and a pencil?

750
00:54:24,656 --> 00:54:26,365
Thanks.

751
00:54:26,449 --> 00:54:28,117
So...

752
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:31,871
Mr. Dekins...

753
00:54:31,955 --> 00:54:36,417
And then Andy says to Mr. Dekins,
"Do you want your sons to go to Harvard,

754
00:54:36,501 --> 00:54:38,627
- or Yale?"
- He didn't say that?

755
00:54:38,712 --> 00:54:41,380
As God is my witness, he did!

756
00:54:41,464 --> 00:54:44,842
Dekins just blinked for a second.
Then he laughed himself silly.

757
00:54:44,926 --> 00:54:46,802
And afterwards he shook Andy's hand.

758
00:54:46,887 --> 00:54:48,262
My ass!

759
00:54:48,346 --> 00:54:49,555
Shook his hand.

760
00:54:49,639 --> 00:54:52,600
Hell, I...I near soiled myself!

761
00:54:52,684 --> 00:54:56,896
All Andy needed was a suit and a tie
and a little jiggly hula girl on his desk,

762
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:58,314
and he would have been:

763
00:54:58,398 --> 00:54:59,940
"Mr. Dufresne, if you please"!

764
00:55:00,025 --> 00:55:01,775
Making a few friends, Andy?

765
00:55:02,819 --> 00:55:04,778
I wouldn't say "friends".

766
00:55:04,863 --> 00:55:08,867
I'm a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning.

767
00:55:08,951 --> 00:55:11,286
It's a wonderful pet to have.

768
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:13,288
Got you out of the laundry, though.

769
00:55:13,372 --> 00:55:15,582
Well, it might do more than that.

770
00:55:15,666 --> 00:55:18,668
How about expanding the library?
Get some new books in there.

771
00:55:18,753 --> 00:55:21,463
If you're gonna ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

772
00:55:21,547 --> 00:55:24,007
- Right.
- How do you expect to do that?

773
00:55:24,091 --> 00:55:29,346
I mean, get new books in here,
Mr. Dufresne, if you please?

774
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:31,181
Ask the Warden for funds.

775
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,894
Son, son. Six wardens
have been through here in my tenure,

776
00:55:35,978 --> 00:55:39,606
and I've learned one immutable, universal truth.

777
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:41,399
Not one of them born...

778
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:46,363
whose asshole wouldn't pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you asked them for funds.

779
00:55:46,447 --> 00:55:48,740
The budget's stretched thin, as it is.

780
00:55:48,824 --> 00:55:50,075
I see.

781
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:53,703
Perhaps I could write to the State Senate
and request funds from them.

782
00:55:53,788 --> 00:55:58,166
As far as they're concerned, there's only three
ways to spend money when it comes to prisons:

783
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:00,335
more walls, more bars and more guards.

784
00:56:00,419 --> 00:56:04,839
Still, I'd like to try, with your permission.
A letter a week. They can't ignore me forever.

785
00:56:04,924 --> 00:56:06,466
Sure can.

786
00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:09,428
But you write your letters,
if it makes you happy.

787
00:56:09,513 --> 00:56:11,806
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?

788
00:56:13,725 --> 00:56:16,769
So, Andy started writing a letter a week,

789
00:56:16,853 --> 00:56:18,938
just like he said.

790
00:56:22,985 --> 00:56:27,113
And, just like Norton said, Andy got no answers.

791
00:56:34,955 --> 00:56:40,459
The following April, Andy did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.

792
00:56:40,544 --> 00:56:43,629
The year after that, he did them all...

793
00:56:43,714 --> 00:56:45,798
including the Warden's.

794
00:56:47,175 --> 00:56:50,928
The year after that, they rescheduled
the start of the intramural season

795
00:56:51,013 --> 00:56:53,097
to coincide with tax season.

796
00:56:55,392 --> 00:56:59,603
The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.

797
00:56:59,688 --> 00:57:03,816
So, Moresby Prison issued you your gun,
but you had to pay for it?

798
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,652
Damn right. The holster, too.

799
00:57:05,737 --> 00:57:06,987
That's tax-deductible.

800
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:08,238
You can write that off.

801
00:57:08,322 --> 00:57:11,658
Yes, sir.
Andy was a regular cottage industry.

802
00:57:11,743 --> 00:57:14,786
In fact, it got so busy at tax time...

803
00:57:14,871 --> 00:57:16,913
he was allowed a staff.

804
00:57:16,998 --> 00:57:19,458
Hey, Red, can you hand me a stack of 1040s?

805
00:57:19,542 --> 00:57:22,210
It got me out of the wood shop
a month out of the year,

806
00:57:22,295 --> 00:57:24,963
and that was fine by me.

807
00:57:25,048 --> 00:57:28,425
And still...he kept sending those letters.

808
00:57:33,723 --> 00:57:35,557
Red, Andy.

809
00:57:35,641 --> 00:57:36,850
It's Brooks.

810
00:57:36,934 --> 00:57:39,394
Watch the door.

811
00:57:39,479 --> 00:57:41,063
Please, Brooks.

812
00:57:41,147 --> 00:57:43,148
- Just calm the fuck down.
- Stay back!

813
00:57:43,232 --> 00:57:45,275
- Stay back!
- What the hell's going on?

814
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:48,445
You tell me. One second he's fine.
Then out comes the knife.

815
00:57:48,529 --> 00:57:50,989
Brooks, we can talk about this. Right?

816
00:57:51,074 --> 00:57:53,200
Nothing to talk about, goddamn it!

817
00:57:53,284 --> 00:57:54,993
I'm gonna cut his fucking throat.

818
00:57:55,078 --> 00:57:56,953
Heywood? Wait, what's he done to you?

819
00:57:57,038 --> 00:57:59,164
It's what they done!

820
00:57:59,248 --> 00:58:00,665
I...I got no choice...

821
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:03,419
You're not gonna hurt him.
Even Heywood knows that.

822
00:58:03,504 --> 00:58:06,130
- Right, Heywood?
- I...I know that, sure.

823
00:58:06,215 --> 00:58:09,634
You won't hurt him, because he's a friend,
and you're a reasonable man.

824
00:58:09,718 --> 00:58:11,010
That's right. Right, guys?

825
00:58:11,095 --> 00:58:14,472
- Yes.
- So, put the knife down. Brooks, look at me.

826
00:58:14,556 --> 00:58:16,390
Put the knife down.

827
00:58:17,476 --> 00:58:18,643
Brooks...

828
00:58:18,727 --> 00:58:20,978
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

829
00:58:21,063 --> 00:58:23,397
Brooks, look at his neck. It's bleeding.

830
00:58:24,733 --> 00:58:26,317
It's the only...

831
00:58:26,401 --> 00:58:28,694
It's the only way they'd let me stay.

832
00:58:28,779 --> 00:58:31,364
Come on. This is crazy.
You don't want to do this.

833
00:58:31,365 --> 00:58:33,449
Put it down.

834
00:58:40,833 --> 00:58:45,545
Come on. Take it easy.
You're going to be all right.

835
00:58:45,629 --> 00:58:47,004
Him?

836
00:58:47,089 --> 00:58:50,758
Hell, what about me?
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat.

837
00:58:50,843 --> 00:58:53,469
Shit, Heywood,
you've had worse from shaving.

838
00:58:53,554 --> 00:58:55,805
What the hell did you do to set him off, anyway?

839
00:58:55,889 --> 00:58:58,224
Nothing. I come in here to say fare-thee-well.

840
00:58:58,308 --> 00:59:01,436
Ain't you heard? His parole's come through.

841
00:59:03,481 --> 00:59:06,608
I just don't understand what happened in there.
That's all.

842
00:59:06,693 --> 00:59:09,278
The old man's as crazy
as a rat in a tin shithouse.

843
00:59:09,362 --> 00:59:11,572
Oh, Heywood, that's enough out of you.

844
00:59:11,656 --> 00:59:14,658
- I heard he had you shitting in your pants.
- Fuck you!

845
00:59:14,742 --> 00:59:16,118
Would you knock it off?

846
00:59:16,202 --> 00:59:18,537
Brooks ain't no bug.

847
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:20,497
He's just...

848
00:59:22,375 --> 00:59:24,209
He's just institutionalized.

849
00:59:25,545 --> 00:59:27,212
Institutionalized, my ass.

850
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:31,592
The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood.
50 years.

851
00:59:31,676 --> 00:59:33,385
This is all he knows.

852
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:35,888
In here, he's an important man.

853
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:37,431
He's an educated man.

854
00:59:37,515 --> 00:59:39,600
Outside, he's nothing.

855
00:59:41,769 --> 00:59:44,396
Just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands.

856
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,691
Probably couldn't get a
library card if he tried.

857
00:59:47,775 --> 00:59:49,860
You know what I'm trying to say?

858
00:59:49,944 --> 00:59:52,696
Red, I do believe you're
talking out of your ass.

859
00:59:53,948 --> 00:59:56,867
You believe whatever you want, Floyd.

860
00:59:56,868 --> 00:59:59,412
But I'm telling you, these walls are funny.

861
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:02,916
First you hate 'em...

862
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:06,544
..then you get used to 'em.

863
01:00:08,172 --> 01:00:10,798
Enough time passes...

864
01:00:10,883 --> 01:00:13,843
you get so you depend on 'em.

865
01:00:13,928 --> 01:00:16,262
That's institutionalized.

866
01:00:16,347 --> 01:00:17,722
Shit.

867
01:00:17,723 --> 01:00:19,349
You can never get like that.

868
01:00:19,433 --> 01:00:21,351
Oh, yeah?

869
01:00:21,435 --> 01:00:24,020
Say that when you've been here
as long as Brooks has.

870
01:00:24,104 --> 01:00:25,980
Goddamn right.

871
01:00:28,317 --> 01:00:30,860
They send you here for life.

872
01:00:30,945 --> 01:00:33,029
That's exactly what they take.

873
01:00:34,949 --> 01:00:37,033
The part that counts, anyway.

874
01:00:44,541 --> 01:00:46,709
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

875
01:00:48,629 --> 01:00:50,463
You go on, now.

876
01:00:51,548 --> 01:00:56,219
You're free.

877
01:01:12,112 --> 01:01:13,988
Bye.

878
01:01:15,073 --> 01:01:16,991
Good luck, Brooks.

879
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:56,281
Dear fellas...

880
01:01:56,365 --> 01:02:00,577
I can't believe
how fast things move on the outside.

881
01:02:01,996 --> 01:02:05,040
Watch it, old-timer! Are
you trying to get killed?

882
01:02:05,124 --> 01:02:08,460
I saw an automobile once, when I was a kid,

883
01:02:08,544 --> 01:02:11,463
but now...they're everywhere.

884
01:02:15,676 --> 01:02:19,262
The world went and got itself
in a big damn hurry.

885
01:02:35,613 --> 01:02:41,910
The parole board got me into
this halfway house called The Brewer,

886
01:02:41,994 --> 01:02:45,789
and a job bagging groceries at the Foodway.

887
01:02:47,833 --> 01:02:53,171
It's hard work, and I try to keep up,
but my hands hurt most of the time.

888
01:02:53,256 --> 01:02:55,257
Make sure your man double-bags.

889
01:02:55,342 --> 01:02:57,593
Last time, the bottom near came out.

890
01:02:57,677 --> 01:03:00,971
Make sure you double-bag, like the lady says.
Understand?

891
01:03:01,056 --> 01:03:02,515
Yes, sir. I surely will.

892
01:03:02,599 --> 01:03:06,394
I don't think
the store manager likes me very much.

893
01:03:09,356 --> 01:03:14,151
Sometimes, after work,
I go to the park and feed the birds.

894
01:03:14,236 --> 01:03:19,573
I keep thinking Jake might just show up
and say hello.

895
01:03:19,658 --> 01:03:21,450
But he never does.

896
01:03:22,536 --> 01:03:27,915
And I hope, wherever he is,
he's doing OK and making new friends.

897
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:34,338
I have trouble sleeping at night.

898
01:03:34,423 --> 01:03:37,216
I have bad dreams, like I'm falling.

899
01:03:38,301 --> 01:03:40,219
I wake up, scared.

900
01:03:40,303 --> 01:03:44,306
Sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where I am.

901
01:03:45,934 --> 01:03:47,393
Maybe I should get me a gun

902
01:03:47,477 --> 01:03:51,356
and rob the Foodway, so they'd send me home.

903
01:03:51,441 --> 01:03:53,775
I could shoot the manager, while I was at it.

904
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:55,819
Sort of like a bonus.

905
01:03:57,321 --> 01:04:01,575
I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense
any more.

906
01:04:01,659 --> 01:04:03,702
I don't like it here.

907
01:04:03,786 --> 01:04:06,455
I'm tired of being afraid all the time.

908
01:04:06,539 --> 01:04:07,622
I've decided...

909
01:04:07,707 --> 01:04:09,583
not to stay.

910
01:04:20,928 --> 01:04:24,431
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss.

911
01:04:24,515 --> 01:04:26,600
Not for an old crook like me.

912
01:05:29,623 --> 01:05:33,668
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss.
Not for an old crook like me.

913
01:05:34,836 --> 01:05:38,881
PS. Tell Heywood
I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat.

914
01:05:38,882 --> 01:05:40,967
No hard feelings. Brooks."

915
01:05:51,688 --> 01:05:53,772
He should have died in here.

916
01:05:59,195 --> 01:06:03,657
What the fuck have you done?
It's a goddamn mess. I'll tell you that.

917
01:06:08,371 --> 01:06:09,788
What's all this?

918
01:06:09,872 --> 01:06:13,750
You tell me, fuck-stick.
They're all addressed to you.

919
01:06:13,835 --> 01:06:15,127
Take it.

920
01:06:24,095 --> 01:06:25,679
"Dear Mr. Dufresne...

921
01:06:26,764 --> 01:06:28,765
In response to your repeated enquiries,

922
01:06:28,850 --> 01:06:33,562
the State has allocated the enclosed funds
for your library project."

923
01:06:33,646 --> 01:06:35,022
This is 200 dollars.

924
01:06:36,065 --> 01:06:39,985
"In addition, the Library District
has generously responded

925
01:06:40,069 --> 01:06:42,779
with a charitable donation
of used books and sundries.

926
01:06:42,864 --> 01:06:44,948
We trust this will fill your needs.

927
01:06:45,033 --> 01:06:49,162
We now consider the matter closed.
Please stop sending us letters."

928
01:06:49,246 --> 01:06:52,081
I want all this cleared out
before the Warden gets back.

929
01:06:52,166 --> 01:06:53,833
Yes, sir.

930
01:06:57,588 --> 01:06:58,963
Good for you, Andy.

931
01:07:01,592 --> 01:07:03,051
Wow!

932
01:07:04,136 --> 01:07:06,220
It only took six years.

933
01:07:07,514 --> 01:07:10,391
From now on,
I'll write two letters a week, instead of one.

934
01:07:10,476 --> 01:07:14,020
Oh, I believe you're crazy enough.
You'd better get all this stuff out,

935
01:07:14,104 --> 01:07:15,271
like the Captain said.

936
01:07:15,356 --> 01:07:19,233
Now, I'm gonna go pinch a loaf.
When I come back, this is all gone, right?

937
01:07:25,407 --> 01:07:27,408
Wow.

938
01:07:57,482 --> 01:08:00,192
Duettino from The Marriage Of Figaro

939
01:08:01,653 --> 01:08:04,238
# Sull'aria...

940
01:08:07,867 --> 01:08:08,867
Andy,

941
01:08:08,952 --> 01:08:10,285
do you hear that?

942
01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:14,081
#..zeffiretto

943
01:08:26,302 --> 01:08:34,143
# Questa será spirera

944
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:08,845
# Sotto i pini

945
01:09:08,929 --> 01:09:14,142
# Del boschetto

946
01:09:15,644 --> 01:09:18,021
# Sotto i pini...

947
01:09:18,105 --> 01:09:20,982
Dufresne?

948
01:09:21,066 --> 01:09:22,650
Dufresne?

949
01:09:22,735 --> 01:09:24,819
Andy, let me out.

950
01:09:27,531 --> 01:09:31,075
Andy?

951
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:36,331
I have no idea to this day what those
two Italian ladies were singing about.

952
01:09:36,415 --> 01:09:38,833
The truth is, I don't want to know.

953
01:09:38,918 --> 01:09:41,003
Some things are best left unsaid.

954
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:47,572
I like to think they were
singing about something

955
01:09:47,573 --> 01:09:50,095
so beautiful, it can't be expressed in words...

956
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:52,556
and makes your heart ache because of it.

957
01:09:54,768 --> 01:09:57,478
I tell you, those voices soared...

958
01:09:57,562 --> 01:10:02,107
higher and farther
than anybody in a grey place dares to dream.

959
01:10:02,192 --> 01:10:05,569
It was like some beautiful bird
flapped into our drab little cage

960
01:10:05,654 --> 01:10:08,781
and made those walls dissolve away.

961
01:10:08,865 --> 01:10:11,200
And for the briefest of moments...

962
01:10:11,284 --> 01:10:14,370
every last man at Shawshank felt free.

963
01:10:16,873 --> 01:10:19,375
It pissed the Warden off something awful.

964
01:10:20,794 --> 01:10:21,919
Open the door.

965
01:10:24,673 --> 01:10:26,590
Open it up!

966
01:10:27,801 --> 01:10:30,177
Dufresne, open this door!

967
01:10:31,805 --> 01:10:33,138
Turn that off!

968
01:10:39,939 --> 01:10:42,691
I am warning you, Dufresne. Turn that off!

969
01:10:56,539 --> 01:10:58,415
Dufresne...

970
01:10:59,542 --> 01:11:01,626
You're mine now.

971
01:11:09,176 --> 01:11:11,928
Andy got two weeks in the hole
for that little stunt.

972
01:11:12,013 --> 01:11:14,431
On your feet!

973
01:11:15,641 --> 01:11:17,726
- Hey, look who's here.
- Maestro!

974
01:11:19,228 --> 01:11:23,273
Y- Y-You couldn't play something good, huh?
Hank Williams or something?

975
01:11:23,357 --> 01:11:26,026
They broke the door down
before I could take requests.

976
01:11:26,110 --> 01:11:27,903
Was it worth it, two weeks in the hole?

977
01:11:27,987 --> 01:11:29,237
Easiest time I ever did.

978
01:11:29,322 --> 01:11:32,365
Bullshit!
There's no such thing as easy time in the hole.

979
01:11:32,366 --> 01:11:34,993
A week in the hole is like a year.

980
01:11:35,077 --> 01:11:37,788
I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

981
01:11:37,873 --> 01:11:41,208
So, they let you tote that record player
down there, huh?

982
01:11:43,337 --> 01:11:44,962
It was in here.

983
01:11:45,047 --> 01:11:46,714
And in here.

984
01:11:47,925 --> 01:11:52,178
That's the beauty of music.
They can't get that from you.

985
01:11:56,099 --> 01:11:58,601
Haven't you ever felt that way about music?

986
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:04,357
Well, I played a mean harmonica,
as a younger man.

987
01:12:04,441 --> 01:12:06,233
Lost interest in it, though.

988
01:12:06,318 --> 01:12:08,152
Didn't make much sense in here.

989
01:12:08,236 --> 01:12:10,696
Here's where it makes the most sense.

990
01:12:10,781 --> 01:12:13,366
You need it, so you don't forget.

991
01:12:13,450 --> 01:12:14,784
Forget?

992
01:12:14,868 --> 01:12:16,827
Forget that...

993
01:12:16,912 --> 01:12:18,996
there are places...

994
01:12:20,332 --> 01:12:22,875
..in the world that aren't made out of stone...

995
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,002
that there's a...

996
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:26,921
there's something...

997
01:12:27,005 --> 01:12:29,799
inside that they can't get to...

998
01:12:29,883 --> 01:12:32,176
that they can't touch.

999
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:34,137
It's yours.

1000
01:12:35,556 --> 01:12:37,265
What are you talking about?

1001
01:12:38,351 --> 01:12:39,935
Hope.

1002
01:12:40,019 --> 01:12:41,895
Hope?

1003
01:12:43,731 --> 01:12:46,400
Let me tell you something, my friend.

1004
01:12:46,484 --> 01:12:48,443
Hope is a dangerous thing.

1005
01:12:50,029 --> 01:12:52,072
Hope can drive a man insane.

1006
01:12:53,116 --> 01:12:55,033
It's got no use on the inside.

1007
01:12:55,118 --> 01:12:57,786
You'd better get used to that idea.

1008
01:13:00,206 --> 01:13:01,832
Like Brooks did?

1009
01:13:27,066 --> 01:13:28,108
Sit down.

1010
01:13:33,323 --> 01:13:36,784
It says here that you've served
30 years of a life sentence.

1011
01:13:36,869 --> 01:13:39,495
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1012
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:41,664
Oh, yes, sir.

1013
01:13:41,665 --> 01:13:43,750
Without a doubt.

1014
01:13:44,793 --> 01:13:47,128
And I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

1015
01:13:49,715 --> 01:13:51,758
No danger to society here.

1016
01:13:51,842 --> 01:13:53,926
God's honest truth.

1017
01:13:56,263 --> 01:13:58,347
Absolutely rehabilitated.

1018
01:14:08,275 --> 01:14:10,359
30 years.

1019
01:14:11,445 --> 01:14:13,488
Jesus, when they say it like that...

1020
01:14:13,572 --> 01:14:15,656
You wonder where it went.

1021
01:14:18,619 --> 01:14:20,703
I wonder where ten years went.

1022
01:14:25,751 --> 01:14:27,043
Here.

1023
01:14:27,127 --> 01:14:29,295
Little parole rejection present.

1024
01:14:31,132 --> 01:14:33,175
Go ahead and open it.

1025
01:14:33,259 --> 01:14:37,054
I had to go through one of your competitors.
I hope you don't mind.

1026
01:14:37,138 --> 01:14:39,223
I wanted it to be a surprise.

1027
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:51,443
It's very pretty, Andy.

1028
01:14:52,529 --> 01:14:54,613
Thank you.

1029
01:14:56,366 --> 01:14:58,450
Are you going to play it?

1030
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:04,665
No.

1031
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,044
Not right now.

1032
01:15:16,302 --> 01:15:18,387
Tier 3 South. Clear.

1033
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:21,473
Tier 4 North. Clear.

1034
01:15:21,558 --> 01:15:23,642
Tier 1 South. Clear.

1035
01:15:26,479 --> 01:15:28,565
Fall in!

1036
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:04,726
Lights out!

1037
01:16:39,638 --> 01:16:41,680
Andy was as good as his word.

1038
01:16:41,765 --> 01:16:44,266
He wrote two letters a week instead of one.

1039
01:16:46,895 --> 01:16:51,023
In 1959, the State Senate
finally clued into the fact

1040
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:53,984
they couldn't buy him off
with just a $200 check.

1041
01:16:54,069 --> 01:17:00,658
Appropriations Committee voted
an annual payment of $500 just to shut him up.

1042
01:17:00,742 --> 01:17:02,451
And you'd be amazed

1043
01:17:02,535 --> 01:17:04,203
how far Andy could stretch it.

1044
01:17:04,287 --> 01:17:07,164
He made deals with book clubs, charity groups.

1045
01:17:07,249 --> 01:17:09,625
He bought remaindered books by the pound.

1046
01:17:09,709 --> 01:17:11,919
Treasure Island.

1047
01:17:12,003 --> 01:17:14,171
Robert Louis...

1048
01:17:14,256 --> 01:17:15,464
..Stevenson.

1049
01:17:15,548 --> 01:17:17,007
Fiction, adventure.

1050
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:20,636
What's next?

1051
01:17:20,637 --> 01:17:23,347
I got here Auto Repair and...

1052
01:17:24,392 --> 01:17:25,725
..Soap Carving.

1053
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:29,187
Trade skills and hobbies. Goes under
Educational. The stack behind you.

1054
01:17:29,272 --> 01:17:31,314
The Count Of Monte Crisco.

1055
01:17:31,399 --> 01:17:33,733
That's Cristo, you dumb shit.

1056
01:17:33,818 --> 01:17:37,612
By Alexandree...Dumass.

1057
01:17:37,697 --> 01:17:42,617
Dumb-ass?

1058
01:17:45,121 --> 01:17:47,455
Dumas. You know what that's about?

1059
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:48,915
Uh-uh.

1060
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,710
You'll like it. It's about a prison break.

1061
01:17:51,794 --> 01:17:55,797
We ought to file that under Educational, too,
oughtn't we?

1062
01:17:55,881 --> 01:18:00,051
The rest of us did our best to pitch in
when and where we could.

1063
01:18:01,304 --> 01:18:03,138
By the year Kennedy was shot,

1064
01:18:03,222 --> 01:18:07,559
Andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of rat turds and turpentine

1065
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:10,895
into the best prison library in New England,

1066
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:14,858
complete with a fine selection of Hank Williams.

1067
01:18:14,942 --> 01:18:19,112
# Lawd I don't know what I'll do-ooo

1068
01:18:19,196 --> 01:18:21,948
# All I do is sit and sigh...

1069
01:18:22,033 --> 01:18:26,787
That was also the year Warden Norton
instituted his famous Inside Out program.

1070
01:18:26,872 --> 01:18:29,582
You may remember reading about it.

1071
01:18:29,666 --> 01:18:33,085
It made all the papers
and got his picture in Look Magazine.

1072
01:18:33,170 --> 01:18:34,837
No free ride.

1073
01:18:34,921 --> 01:18:37,882
But rather a genuine, progressive advance

1074
01:18:37,966 --> 01:18:40,134
in corrections and rehabilitation.

1075
01:18:41,178 --> 01:18:43,512
Our inmates, properly supervised,

1076
01:18:43,597 --> 01:18:46,349
will be put to work outside these walls,

1077
01:18:46,433 --> 01:18:48,517
performing all manner of public service.

1078
01:18:48,602 --> 01:18:52,521
These men can learn
the value of an honest day's labor,

1079
01:18:52,606 --> 01:18:56,275
while providing a valuable service
to the community and...

1080
01:18:56,360 --> 01:19:01,572
at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr. and Mrs. John Q Taxpayer.

1081
01:19:01,656 --> 01:19:04,325
Of course,
Norton failed to mention to the press

1082
01:19:04,409 --> 01:19:07,703
that "bare minimum of expense"
is a fairly loose term.

1083
01:19:07,788 --> 01:19:10,956
There are a hundred different ways
to skim off the top.

1084
01:19:11,041 --> 01:19:13,667
Men, materials, you name it.

1085
01:19:14,711 --> 01:19:17,463
And, oh, my Lord, how the money rolled in.

1086
01:19:17,547 --> 01:19:19,673
If this keeps up, you'll put me out of business.

1087
01:19:19,758 --> 01:19:21,927
- Ned!
- This pool of slave labor you've got,

1088
01:19:22,011 --> 01:19:24,054
you can underbid any contractor in town.

1089
01:19:24,138 --> 01:19:28,100
Ned, we're providing
a valuable community service here.

1090
01:19:28,184 --> 01:19:30,435
Well, that's fine for the papers

1091
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,020
but I've got a family to feed.

1092
01:19:32,105 --> 01:19:33,814
Sam...

1093
01:19:33,898 --> 01:19:36,358
Sam, we go back a long way.

1094
01:19:36,442 --> 01:19:38,777
I need this new highway contract.

1095
01:19:38,861 --> 01:19:41,071
I don't get it, and I go under.

1096
01:19:41,155 --> 01:19:43,198
That's a fact.

1097
01:19:43,282 --> 01:19:45,367
You just have some of this fine pie

1098
01:19:45,451 --> 01:19:47,494
my missus made especially for you,

1099
01:19:47,578 --> 01:19:48,912
and you think about that.

1100
01:19:56,963 --> 01:19:59,881
Ned, I wouldn't worry too much
about this contract.

1101
01:19:59,966 --> 01:20:03,176
It seems to me I already got
my boys committed elsewhere.

1102
01:20:05,054 --> 01:20:07,639
You be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie.

1103
01:20:09,267 --> 01:20:11,435
And behind every shady deal,

1104
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:13,728
behind every dollar earned,

1105
01:20:13,813 --> 01:20:16,982
there was Andy, keeping the books.

1106
01:20:18,025 --> 01:20:21,446
Two deposits.
Maine National and New England First.

1107
01:20:21,530 --> 01:20:23,614
Night drops as always, sir.

1108
01:20:54,021 --> 01:20:55,771
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1109
01:20:55,856 --> 01:20:58,649
- Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.
- Yes, sir.

1110
01:20:58,734 --> 01:21:02,487
Tell them if they over-starch my shirts again,
they'll hear about it from me.

1111
01:21:02,571 --> 01:21:04,572
How do I look?

1112
01:21:04,656 --> 01:21:07,366
- Very nice, sir.
- Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1113
01:21:07,451 --> 01:21:09,160
The Governor's going to be there.

1114
01:21:10,579 --> 01:21:12,622
Want the rest of this?

1115
01:21:12,706 --> 01:21:14,790
The woman can't bake worth shit.

1116
01:21:16,168 --> 01:21:17,961
Thank you, sir.

1117
01:21:20,131 --> 01:21:23,884
- He's got his fingers in a lot of pies, I hear.
- What you hear isn't half of it.

1118
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:26,428
He's got scams you haven't even dreamed of.

1119
01:21:26,513 --> 01:21:28,555
Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

1120
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:31,517
There's a river of dirty money
running through this place.

1121
01:21:31,601 --> 01:21:34,853
But the problem with having all that money
is you'll have to explain

1122
01:21:34,938 --> 01:21:37,523
- where it came from.
- That's where I come in.

1123
01:21:37,607 --> 01:21:40,108
I channel it, filter it, funnel it.

1124
01:21:40,193 --> 01:21:42,736
Stocks, securities, tax-free municipals.

1125
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:45,489
I send that money out into the real world.

1126
01:21:45,573 --> 01:21:49,201
- And when it comes back...
- Clean as a virgin's honey pot, huh?

1127
01:21:49,285 --> 01:21:50,494
Cleaner.

1128
01:21:50,578 --> 01:21:54,206
By the time Norton retires,
I'll have made him a millionaire.

1129
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:01,380
If they ever catch on, though, he's gonna
wind up in here wearing a number himself.

1130
01:22:01,464 --> 01:22:04,716
Now, Red, I thought you had
a little more faith in me than that.

1131
01:22:04,801 --> 01:22:08,095
I know you're good, Andy,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

1132
01:22:08,179 --> 01:22:11,181
Now, anybody gets curious,
the FBI, the IRS, whatever,

1133
01:22:11,266 --> 01:22:14,101
it's gonna lead to somebody.

1134
01:22:14,185 --> 01:22:16,145
Sure it is. But not to me.

1135
01:22:16,230 --> 01:22:18,231
And certainly not to the Warden.

1136
01:22:22,278 --> 01:22:23,570
All right. Who?

1137
01:22:23,654 --> 01:22:25,363
Randall Stevens.

1138
01:22:25,447 --> 01:22:26,614
Who?

1139
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:32,412
The silent silent partner. He's the guilty one,
Your Honor. The man with the bank accounts.

1140
01:22:32,496 --> 01:22:34,664
That's where the filtering process starts.

1141
01:22:34,748 --> 01:22:37,917
If they trace anything,
it's just going to lead to him.

1142
01:22:38,002 --> 01:22:39,586
But who is he?

1143
01:22:39,670 --> 01:22:41,713
He's a phantom, an apparition.

1144
01:22:41,797 --> 01:22:43,756
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1145
01:22:43,841 --> 01:22:46,009
I conjured him...

1146
01:22:46,093 --> 01:22:48,136
out of thin air.

1147
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:51,055
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1148
01:22:54,184 --> 01:22:56,561
Andy, you canâ€™t just make a person up.

1149
01:22:56,645 --> 01:22:59,772
Sure you can, if you know how
the system works, where the cracks are.

1150
01:22:59,857 --> 01:23:03,359
It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail.

1151
01:23:03,444 --> 01:23:06,070
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate,

1152
01:23:06,155 --> 01:23:08,489
a driver's license, social security number.

1153
01:23:08,574 --> 01:23:09,782
You're shitting me?

1154
01:23:09,867 --> 01:23:11,826
If they ever trace any of those accounts,

1155
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:14,788
they're going to wind up chasing
a figment of my imagination.

1156
01:23:14,873 --> 01:23:16,957
Well, I'll be damned.

1157
01:23:18,251 --> 01:23:20,294
Did I say you were good?

1158
01:23:20,378 --> 01:23:22,546
Shit, you're a Rembrandt!

1159
01:23:22,631 --> 01:23:24,673
You know, the funny thing is,

1160
01:23:24,758 --> 01:23:28,719
on the outside, I was an honest man,
straight as an arrow.

1161
01:23:29,763 --> 01:23:32,139
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1162
01:23:40,899 --> 01:23:42,274
Ever bother you?

1163
01:23:43,318 --> 01:23:46,737
I don't run the scams, Red,
I just process the profits.

1164
01:23:46,821 --> 01:23:48,864
Fine line maybe but...

1165
01:23:48,948 --> 01:23:51,659
I also built that library

1166
01:23:51,743 --> 01:23:54,370
and used it to help a dozen guys
get a high school diploma.

1167
01:23:54,454 --> 01:23:56,330
Why do you think the Warden lets me do it?

1168
01:23:56,414 --> 01:23:59,166
To keep you happy and doing the laundry.

1169
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:01,377
Money instead of sheets.

1170
01:24:01,461 --> 01:24:04,171
Well, I work cheap. That's the trade-off.

1171
01:24:09,761 --> 01:24:11,971
Willy And The Hand Jive

1172
01:24:19,772 --> 01:24:21,564
# I know a cat named...

1173
01:24:21,649 --> 01:24:24,317
Tommy Williams
came to Shawshank in 1965

1174
01:24:24,402 --> 01:24:26,444
on a two-year stretch for B&E.

1175
01:24:26,529 --> 01:24:28,655
That's breaking and entering to you.

1176
01:24:28,739 --> 01:24:33,368
The cops caught him sneaking TV sets
out the back door of a JC Penney.

1177
01:24:33,452 --> 01:24:35,203
Young punk.

1178
01:24:35,287 --> 01:24:37,330
Mr. Rock'n'roll.

1179
01:24:37,415 --> 01:24:39,082
Cocky as hell.

1180
01:24:39,166 --> 01:24:41,751
Hey, come on, old boys! Moving like molasses!

1181
01:24:41,836 --> 01:24:43,795
Making me look bad.

1182
01:24:43,796 --> 01:24:45,755
We liked him immediately.

1183
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:47,882
So I'm backing out the door, right?

1184
01:24:47,967 --> 01:24:49,676
And I got the TV like this.

1185
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:53,596
It was a big old thing. I couldn't see shit.
Suddenly, I hears this voice.

1186
01:24:53,681 --> 01:24:55,724
"Freeze, kid! Hands in the air."

1187
01:24:55,808 --> 01:24:57,475
Well, I just stand there,

1188
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:00,353
holding onto that TV.
So, finally, the voice says,

1189
01:25:00,438 --> 01:25:02,397
"Do you hear what I said, boy?"

1190
01:25:02,481 --> 01:25:04,858
I say, "Yes, sir, I sure did.

1191
01:25:04,942 --> 01:25:08,570
But if I drop this fucking thing,
you got me on destruction of property, too."

1192
01:25:12,659 --> 01:25:15,369
Hey, you've done a stretch in Cashman, right?

1193
01:25:15,454 --> 01:25:19,290
Yeah. Yeah, that was an easy piece of time,
let me tell you.

1194
01:25:19,374 --> 01:25:22,001
Weekend furloughs, work programs.

1195
01:25:22,085 --> 01:25:23,502
Not like here.

1196
01:25:23,587 --> 01:25:25,921
Sounds like you done time
all over New England.

1197
01:25:26,006 --> 01:25:31,093
Yeah, I've been in and out since I was 13. You
name the place, chances are I've been there.

1198
01:25:31,178 --> 01:25:35,181
Perhaps it's time you tried a new profession?

1199
01:25:35,265 --> 01:25:40,352
What I mean is, you don't seem to be a good
thief. Maybe you should try something else.

1200
01:25:40,437 --> 01:25:44,273
Yeah, well, what the hell
do you know about it, Capone?

1201
01:25:44,357 --> 01:25:46,108
What are you in for?

1202
01:25:46,193 --> 01:25:47,818
Me?

1203
01:25:49,321 --> 01:25:51,405
The lawyer fucked me.

1204
01:25:55,118 --> 01:25:58,537
Everybody's innocent in here.
Don't you know that?

1205
01:26:06,004 --> 01:26:10,175
As it turned out, Tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl.

1206
01:26:11,219 --> 01:26:13,783
Maybe it was the thought of them on the streets

1207
01:26:13,784 --> 01:26:16,348
or his child growing up not knowing her daddy.

1208
01:26:16,432 --> 01:26:20,268
Whatever it was,
something lit a fire under that boy's ass.

1209
01:26:24,232 --> 01:26:27,484
I was thinking of maybe
trying for my high school equivalency.

1210
01:26:27,568 --> 01:26:30,153
I hear you helped a couple of fellas with that.

1211
01:26:31,364 --> 01:26:33,573
I don't waste time on losers, Tommy.

1212
01:26:35,159 --> 01:26:37,244
I ain't no goddamn loser.

1213
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:41,164
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

1214
01:26:42,834 --> 01:26:44,876
You really mean that?

1215
01:26:44,961 --> 01:26:46,628
Yes, sir, I do.

1216
01:26:46,712 --> 01:26:48,839
Good. Because if we do this,

1217
01:26:48,923 --> 01:26:51,675
we do it all the way, 100%, nothing half-assed.

1218
01:26:52,802 --> 01:26:54,886
The thing is, see...

1219
01:26:56,055 --> 01:26:57,889
..I don't read so good.

1220
01:26:59,016 --> 01:27:00,225
Well.

1221
01:27:01,978 --> 01:27:04,020
You don't read...

1222
01:27:04,105 --> 01:27:06,190
so well.

1223
01:27:07,651 --> 01:27:09,318
We'll get to that.

1224
01:27:10,404 --> 01:27:12,154
- R.
- R...

1225
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:13,614
- S.
- S...

1226
01:27:13,699 --> 01:27:15,867
So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

1227
01:27:15,951 --> 01:27:18,369
He started walking him through his ABCs.

1228
01:27:20,038 --> 01:27:22,623
Tommy took to it pretty well, too.

1229
01:27:22,708 --> 01:27:25,668
The boy found brains he never knew he had.

1230
01:27:28,005 --> 01:27:31,799
Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.

1231
01:27:31,884 --> 01:27:33,843
He really liked the kid.

1232
01:27:33,927 --> 01:27:37,096
It gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.

1233
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:40,182
But that wasn't the only reason.

1234
01:27:40,267 --> 01:27:42,727
Prison time is slow time.

1235
01:27:43,770 --> 01:27:46,022
So you do what you can to keep going.

1236
01:27:46,106 --> 01:27:48,357
Some fellas collect stamps.

1237
01:27:48,358 --> 01:27:50,985
Others build matchstick houses.

1238
01:27:52,029 --> 01:27:54,405
Andy built a library.

1239
01:27:55,449 --> 01:27:57,491
Now he needed a new project.

1240
01:27:57,576 --> 01:27:59,619
Tommy was it.

1241
01:27:59,703 --> 01:28:03,916
It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.

1242
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,628
The same reason
he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.

1243
01:28:09,005 --> 01:28:10,505
In prison,

1244
01:28:10,590 --> 01:28:13,717
a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1245
01:28:15,178 --> 01:28:19,640
By 1966, right about the time
Tommy was getting ready to take his exams,

1246
01:28:19,641 --> 01:28:21,683
it was lovely Raquel.

1247
01:28:38,952 --> 01:28:39,993
Time.

1248
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,292
Well?

1249
01:28:48,378 --> 01:28:49,920
Well, it's for shit.

1250
01:28:50,004 --> 01:28:52,506
I wasted a whole fucking year of my time

1251
01:28:52,590 --> 01:28:55,759
- with this bullshit.
- It's probably not as bad as you think.

1252
01:28:55,843 --> 01:28:59,554
It's worse. I didn't get one thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

1253
01:28:59,639 --> 01:29:02,141
Let's see how the score comes out.

1254
01:29:02,226 --> 01:29:04,852
Well, I'll tell you how the goddamn score
comes out.

1255
01:29:06,647 --> 01:29:08,564
Two points right there.

1256
01:29:08,649 --> 01:29:10,441
There's your goddamn score!

1257
01:29:10,526 --> 01:29:14,362
Goddamn cats crawling up trees,
5x5 is 25.

1258
01:29:15,447 --> 01:29:16,990
Fuck this place!

1259
01:29:16,991 --> 01:29:18,282
Fuck it!

1260
01:29:37,094 --> 01:29:39,846
I feel bad. I let him down.

1261
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:42,015
Ah, that's crap, kid.

1262
01:29:42,016 --> 01:29:43,558
He's proud of you.

1263
01:29:43,642 --> 01:29:46,769
We've been friends a long time
so I know him as good as anybody.

1264
01:29:46,854 --> 01:29:49,731
- A smart fellow, ain't he?
- As smart as they come.

1265
01:29:49,815 --> 01:29:51,858
He used to be a banker on the outside.

1266
01:29:51,942 --> 01:29:53,985
What's he in here for, anyway?

1267
01:29:54,069 --> 01:29:55,570
Murder.

1268
01:29:56,697 --> 01:29:58,448
The hell you say!

1269
01:30:00,577 --> 01:30:02,870
You wouldn't think it to look at the guy.

1270
01:30:03,913 --> 01:30:06,373
He caught his wife in bed with some golf pro.

1271
01:30:06,458 --> 01:30:08,542
He greased them both.

1272
01:30:16,426 --> 01:30:18,302
What?

1273
01:30:18,386 --> 01:30:20,763
About four years ago,

1274
01:30:20,847 --> 01:30:23,932
I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.

1275
01:30:25,185 --> 01:30:28,270
I stole a car. It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1276
01:30:29,564 --> 01:30:31,607
About six months left to go,

1277
01:30:31,691 --> 01:30:33,734
I get a new cellmate in.

1278
01:30:33,818 --> 01:30:35,694
Elmo Blatch.

1279
01:30:36,738 --> 01:30:38,322
Big, twitchy fucker.

1280
01:30:38,323 --> 01:30:40,616
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.

1281
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:42,743
You know what I'm saying?

1282
01:30:42,827 --> 01:30:44,870
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1283
01:30:44,954 --> 01:30:48,165
He said he'd pulled hundreds of jobs.

1284
01:30:48,249 --> 01:30:50,125
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.

1285
01:30:50,210 --> 01:30:53,212
You'd cut a loud fart,
he'd jump three feet in the air.

1286
01:30:54,339 --> 01:30:56,381
Talked all the time, too.

1287
01:30:56,466 --> 01:30:58,802
That's the other thing. He never shut up.

1288
01:30:58,886 --> 01:31:00,929
Places he'd been in,

1289
01:31:01,013 --> 01:31:03,681
jobs he'd pulled, women he'd fucked.

1290
01:31:03,766 --> 01:31:06,184
Even people he'd killed.

1291
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:10,396
People who gave him shit.

1292
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,483
That's how he put it.

1293
01:31:13,567 --> 01:31:15,110
So...

1294
01:31:15,194 --> 01:31:17,278
one night, like a joke,

1295
01:31:18,322 --> 01:31:21,616
I say to him, I say,
"Yeah, Elmo, who did you kill?"

1296
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:23,493
So he says...

1297
01:31:23,577 --> 01:31:27,205
I got me this job one time
bussing tables at a country club.

1298
01:31:28,332 --> 01:31:31,918
So I could case
all these big rich pricks that come in.

1299
01:31:34,338 --> 01:31:36,339
So I pick out this guy,

1300
01:31:37,383 --> 01:31:39,968
go in one night and do his place.

1301
01:31:42,138 --> 01:31:44,139
He wakes up.

1302
01:31:44,223 --> 01:31:46,266
He gives me shit.

1303
01:31:47,309 --> 01:31:49,394
So I killed him.

1304
01:31:50,437 --> 01:31:52,522
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1305
01:31:54,817 --> 01:31:56,735
That's the best part.

1306
01:31:57,779 --> 01:32:00,990
She's fucking this prick, see, this golf pro.

1307
01:32:01,074 --> 01:32:03,159
But she's married to some other guy.

1308
01:32:04,202 --> 01:32:06,287
Some hotshot banker.

1309
01:32:08,081 --> 01:32:10,166
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1310
01:32:21,303 --> 01:32:25,139
I have to say
that's the most amazing story I ever heard.

1311
01:32:26,766 --> 01:32:29,643
What amazes me most is
you were taken in by it.

1312
01:32:29,728 --> 01:32:31,353
Sir?

1313
01:32:31,438 --> 01:32:33,105
Well...

1314
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:36,567
it's obvious this fella Williams
is impressed with you.

1315
01:32:36,651 --> 01:32:38,736
He hears your tale of woe

1316
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:41,739
and quite naturally wants to cheer you up.

1317
01:32:41,823 --> 01:32:43,866
He's young, not terribly bright.

1318
01:32:43,950 --> 01:32:47,828
Not surprising he wouldn't know
what a state he'd put you in.

1319
01:32:47,913 --> 01:32:50,039
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1320
01:32:50,123 --> 01:32:54,169
Well, let's say, for the moment,
this Blatch does exist.

1321
01:32:54,253 --> 01:32:57,380
You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry,

1322
01:32:57,465 --> 01:32:59,674
"Yes, I did it! I confess!

1323
01:32:59,759 --> 01:33:01,968
And by the way,
add a life term to my sentence"?

1324
01:33:02,053 --> 01:33:05,222
That doesn't matter.
With Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial.

1325
01:33:05,306 --> 01:33:08,516
That's assuming Blatch is even still there.

1326
01:33:08,601 --> 01:33:10,644
The chances are he'd be released by now.

1327
01:33:10,728 --> 01:33:13,313
They'd have his last address,
names of relatives.

1328
01:33:13,397 --> 01:33:15,565
There's a chance, isn't there?

1329
01:33:17,610 --> 01:33:19,486
How can you be so obtuse?

1330
01:33:19,570 --> 01:33:21,071
What?

1331
01:33:22,573 --> 01:33:24,407
What did you call me?

1332
01:33:24,492 --> 01:33:26,326
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1333
01:33:26,410 --> 01:33:28,203
Son, you're forgetting yourself.

1334
01:33:28,287 --> 01:33:31,122
The country club will have his old timecards,

1335
01:33:31,207 --> 01:33:33,333
records, W-2s,

1336
01:33:33,417 --> 01:33:37,420
- with his name on them. - If you
indulge this fantasy, that's your business.

1337
01:33:37,505 --> 01:33:41,466
- Don't make it mine. This meeting is over.
- Sir, if I were to ever get out,

1338
01:33:41,550 --> 01:33:46,554
I would never mention what goes on in here. I'd
be as indictable as you for laundering money.

1339
01:33:48,349 --> 01:33:51,351
Don't ever mention money to me again,
you sorry son of a bitch!

1340
01:33:51,436 --> 01:33:53,312
Not in this office.

1341
01:33:53,313 --> 01:33:55,439
Not anywhere! Get in here now.

1342
01:33:55,524 --> 01:33:58,776
I'm just trying to set your mind at ease,
that's all. Sir, I...

1343
01:33:58,860 --> 01:34:00,236
Solitary. A month.

1344
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,488
- Yes, sir.
- What's the matter with you?

1345
01:34:02,572 --> 01:34:05,825
- Get him out of here.
- This is my chance to get out! Don't you see?

1346
01:34:05,826 --> 01:34:07,827
It's my life! Don't you understand?

1347
01:34:07,911 --> 01:34:10,371
- Get him out! Get him out!
- This is my life!

1348
01:34:10,455 --> 01:34:11,706
No!

1349
01:34:11,790 --> 01:34:13,624
A month in the hole.

1350
01:34:13,709 --> 01:34:16,294
It's the longest damn stretch I ever heard of.

1351
01:34:16,378 --> 01:34:18,170
It's all my fault.

1352
01:34:18,255 --> 01:34:19,672
Oh, bullshit.

1353
01:34:19,756 --> 01:34:23,050
You didn't pull the trigger
and you certainly didn't convict him.

1354
01:34:23,135 --> 01:34:25,511
Red, are you saying that Andy is innocent?

1355
01:34:25,595 --> 01:34:27,763
I mean, for real innocent?

1356
01:34:27,848 --> 01:34:29,890
It looks that way.

1357
01:34:29,975 --> 01:34:32,018
Sweet Jesus.

1358
01:34:32,102 --> 01:34:34,145
How long's he been here now?

1359
01:34:34,229 --> 01:34:36,272
1947. What is that?

1360
01:34:36,356 --> 01:34:37,898
- 19 years.
19 years...

1361
01:34:37,983 --> 01:34:40,609
Williams, Thomas.
- Yeah, over here.

1362
01:34:42,988 --> 01:34:45,239
- Paxon, Edward.
- Yeah.

1363
01:34:46,450 --> 01:34:49,368
What you got? Board of Education.

1364
01:34:49,453 --> 01:34:52,122
- The son of a bitch mailed it.
- Looks like he did.

1365
01:34:52,206 --> 01:34:55,250
Are you gonna open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1366
01:34:55,335 --> 01:34:57,419
The thumb up my butt sounds better.

1367
01:34:58,463 --> 01:35:01,214
Hey, Skeet, come on,
give me that, you shithead.

1368
01:35:02,258 --> 01:35:04,468
- Floyd, come on.
- Over here, over here!

1369
01:35:05,511 --> 01:35:07,596
Hey, Red!

1370
01:35:08,723 --> 01:35:11,141
Come on, will you throw that away, please?

1371
01:35:16,731 --> 01:35:18,815
Well, shit.

1372
01:35:31,037 --> 01:35:33,747
The kid passed. C+ average.

1373
01:35:33,831 --> 01:35:35,916
Thought you'd like to know.

1374
01:35:52,476 --> 01:35:54,560
The Warden wants to talk.

1375
01:36:07,950 --> 01:36:09,075
Out here?

1376
01:36:09,159 --> 01:36:11,244
That's what the man said.

1377
01:36:27,553 --> 01:36:29,345
Warden?

1378
01:36:29,430 --> 01:36:31,514
Tommy.

1379
01:36:36,979 --> 01:36:38,438
Tommy...

1380
01:36:38,522 --> 01:36:42,608
I'm asking you to keep this conversation
just between us.

1381
01:36:44,027 --> 01:36:46,113
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1382
01:37:04,591 --> 01:37:06,675
We got a situation here.

1383
01:37:07,719 --> 01:37:09,761
I think you can appreciate that.

1384
01:37:09,846 --> 01:37:11,305
Yes, sir.

1385
01:37:11,389 --> 01:37:12,890
I sure can.

1386
01:37:12,974 --> 01:37:17,019
I tell you, son, this thing really came along
and knocked my wind out.

1387
01:37:18,730 --> 01:37:21,273
It's got me up nights, that's the truth.

1388
01:37:23,485 --> 01:37:25,569
The right thing to do.

1389
01:37:26,905 --> 01:37:29,907
Sometimes it's hard to know what that is.

1390
01:37:31,618 --> 01:37:33,660
You understand?

1391
01:37:35,038 --> 01:37:37,122
I need your help, son.

1392
01:37:38,541 --> 01:37:40,626
If I'm going to move on this,

1393
01:37:40,627 --> 01:37:43,378
there can't be the least little shred of doubt.

1394
01:37:44,924 --> 01:37:48,343
I have to know
if what you told Dufresne was the truth.

1395
01:37:48,427 --> 01:37:50,011
Yes, sir.

1396
01:37:50,012 --> 01:37:51,638
Absolutely.

1397
01:37:51,722 --> 01:37:54,807
Would you be willing
to swear before a judge and jury,

1398
01:37:54,892 --> 01:37:57,310
having placed your hand on the Good Book

1399
01:37:57,311 --> 01:38:00,021
and taken an oath before Almighty God himself?

1400
01:38:00,105 --> 01:38:02,232
Just give me that chance.

1401
01:38:06,153 --> 01:38:07,820
That's what I thought.

1402
01:38:54,911 --> 01:38:56,996
I'm sure by now you've heard...

1403
01:38:58,248 --> 01:38:59,623
A terrible thing.

1404
01:39:01,084 --> 01:39:04,670
A man that young, less than a year to go,
trying to escape.

1405
01:39:05,755 --> 01:39:08,382
It broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.

1406
01:39:09,426 --> 01:39:11,510
Truly, it did.

1407
01:39:13,555 --> 01:39:15,639
We just have to put it behind us.

1408
01:39:17,809 --> 01:39:19,226
Move on.

1409
01:39:20,687 --> 01:39:22,563
I'm done.

1410
01:39:23,607 --> 01:39:25,691
Everything stops.

1411
01:39:26,735 --> 01:39:29,570
Get someone else to run your scams.

1412
01:39:30,905 --> 01:39:32,990
Nothing stops.

1413
01:39:34,034 --> 01:39:36,118
Nothing.

1414
01:39:37,871 --> 01:39:39,956
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

1415
01:39:41,834 --> 01:39:44,419
No more protection from the guards.

1416
01:39:44,503 --> 01:39:46,838
I'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton

1417
01:39:46,922 --> 01:39:49,090
and cast you down with the Sodomites.

1418
01:39:50,843 --> 01:39:53,345
You'll think you've been fucked by a train.

1419
01:39:54,639 --> 01:39:56,681
And the library?

1420
01:39:56,766 --> 01:39:57,891
Gone.

1421
01:39:57,975 --> 01:40:00,352
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1422
01:40:01,395 --> 01:40:04,189
We'll have us a little
book barbecue in the yard.

1423
01:40:04,273 --> 01:40:06,316
They'll see the flames for miles.

1424
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:08,902
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1425
01:40:10,488 --> 01:40:12,405
You understand me?

1426
01:40:12,490 --> 01:40:14,574
Catching my drift?

1427
01:40:17,662 --> 01:40:19,746
Or am I being obtuse?

1428
01:40:30,883 --> 01:40:33,009
Give him another month to think about it.

1429
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:23,644
My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.

1430
01:41:23,729 --> 01:41:25,813
Like a closed book.

1431
01:41:27,023 --> 01:41:29,775
Complained about it all the time.

1432
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:31,944
She was beautiful.

1433
01:41:34,156 --> 01:41:36,241
God, I loved her.

1434
01:41:39,245 --> 01:41:41,580
I just didn't know how to show it, that's all.

1435
01:41:44,083 --> 01:41:46,168
I killed her, Red.

1436
01:41:47,628 --> 01:41:49,713
I didn't pull the trigger.

1437
01:41:51,132 --> 01:41:53,216
But I drove her away.

1438
01:41:54,427 --> 01:41:56,970
That's why she died, because of me.

1439
01:41:57,054 --> 01:41:59,139
The way I am.

1440
01:42:07,482 --> 01:42:09,566
That don't make you a murderer.

1441
01:42:12,779 --> 01:42:14,863
A bad husband, maybe.

1442
01:42:18,242 --> 01:42:21,620
Feel bad about it if you want to,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

1443
01:42:21,704 --> 01:42:23,121
No, I didn't.

1444
01:42:23,206 --> 01:42:25,248
Somebody else did.

1445
01:42:26,542 --> 01:42:28,627
And I wound up in here.

1446
01:42:31,005 --> 01:42:33,089
Bad luck, I guess.

1447
01:42:36,011 --> 01:42:37,720
Yeah.

1448
01:42:37,805 --> 01:42:40,097
It floats around.

1449
01:42:40,182 --> 01:42:42,642
It's got to land on somebody.

1450
01:42:42,726 --> 01:42:44,977
It was my turn, that's all.

1451
01:42:46,063 --> 01:42:48,523
I was in the path of the tornado.

1452
01:42:55,113 --> 01:42:58,866
I just didn't expect
the storm would last as long as it has.

1453
01:43:02,955 --> 01:43:04,872
Do you think you'll ever get out of here?

1454
01:43:06,124 --> 01:43:07,792
Me?

1455
01:43:10,087 --> 01:43:11,546
Yeah.

1456
01:43:12,589 --> 01:43:14,549
One day, when I've got a long, white beard

1457
01:43:14,633 --> 01:43:18,135
and two or three marbles rolling
around upstairs, they'll let me out.

1458
01:43:20,055 --> 01:43:22,139
I tell you where I'd go.

1459
01:43:23,350 --> 01:43:24,976
Zihuatanejo.

1460
01:43:25,060 --> 01:43:26,978
Zi...what?

1461
01:43:27,062 --> 01:43:29,105
Zihuatanejo.

1462
01:43:29,189 --> 01:43:31,274
It's in Mexico.

1463
01:43:33,069 --> 01:43:35,279
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1464
01:43:36,531 --> 01:43:38,907
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

1465
01:43:38,992 --> 01:43:40,450
No.

1466
01:43:40,535 --> 01:43:42,619
They say it has no memory.

1467
01:43:45,081 --> 01:43:47,624
That's where I want to live the rest of my life.

1468
01:43:49,210 --> 01:43:51,295
A warm place with no memory.

1469
01:43:54,591 --> 01:43:56,884
Open up a little hotel,

1470
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:00,596
right on the beach.

1471
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:02,723
Buy some worthless old boat,

1472
01:44:02,807 --> 01:44:04,892
fix it up new.

1473
01:44:07,854 --> 01:44:09,062
Take my guests out.

1474
01:44:09,147 --> 01:44:11,231
Charter fishing.

1475
01:44:15,153 --> 01:44:17,779
Zihuatanejo, huh?

1476
01:44:20,408 --> 01:44:24,286
In a place like that, I could use a man
who knows how to get things.

1477
01:44:30,711 --> 01:44:33,421
I don't think I could make
it on the outside, Andy.

1478
01:44:40,179 --> 01:44:42,263
I've been in here most of my life.

1479
01:44:43,766 --> 01:44:45,558
I'm an institutional man now.

1480
01:44:45,643 --> 01:44:47,727
Just like Brooks was.

1481
01:44:49,146 --> 01:44:51,397
Well, you underestimate yourself.

1482
01:44:51,482 --> 01:44:53,566
I don't think so.

1483
01:44:56,195 --> 01:45:00,406
I mean...in here, I'm the guy
who can get things for you, sure.

1484
01:45:00,491 --> 01:45:04,410
But outside, all you need is the Yellow Pages.

1485
01:45:04,495 --> 01:45:06,913
Hell, I wouldn't even know where to begin.

1486
01:45:08,999 --> 01:45:11,334
The Pacific Ocean?

1487
01:45:11,418 --> 01:45:13,461
Shit.

1488
01:45:13,545 --> 01:45:16,714
- About scare me to death, something that big.
- Not me.

1489
01:45:16,799 --> 01:45:20,259
I didn't shoot my wife
and I didn't shoot her lover.

1490
01:45:22,179 --> 01:45:25,807
Whatever mistakes I've made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1491
01:45:25,891 --> 01:45:28,059
That hotel, that boat.

1492
01:45:29,646 --> 01:45:31,814
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1493
01:45:36,444 --> 01:45:39,321
I don't think you ought to be
doing this to yourself, Andy.

1494
01:45:39,406 --> 01:45:41,448
These are just shitty pipe dreams.

1495
01:45:41,533 --> 01:45:44,493
I mean, Mexico is way the hell down there
and you're in here.

1496
01:45:44,577 --> 01:45:46,620
And that's the way it is.

1497
01:45:46,705 --> 01:45:49,331
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.

1498
01:45:51,084 --> 01:45:53,168
It's down there and I'm in here.

1499
01:45:55,880 --> 01:45:58,674
I guess it comes down
to a simple choice, really.

1500
01:46:01,511 --> 01:46:03,554
Get busy living

1501
01:46:03,638 --> 01:46:06,557
or get busy dying.

1502
01:46:10,353 --> 01:46:12,438
Andy.

1503
01:46:14,899 --> 01:46:16,984
Red.

1504
01:46:18,028 --> 01:46:20,446
If you ever get out of here, do me a favor.

1505
01:46:20,530 --> 01:46:22,364
Sure, Andy.

1506
01:46:22,449 --> 01:46:23,782
Anything.

1507
01:46:24,868 --> 01:46:28,329
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1508
01:46:30,332 --> 01:46:34,127
- Well, just... There's a lot of
hayfields up there. - One in particular.

1509
01:46:34,211 --> 01:46:36,254
It's got a long rock wall

1510
01:46:36,338 --> 01:46:38,256
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1511
01:46:38,340 --> 01:46:41,051
It's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.

1512
01:46:42,428 --> 01:46:45,138
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1513
01:46:46,348 --> 01:46:50,143
We went there for a picnic
and made love under that oak.

1514
01:46:51,645 --> 01:46:53,730
I asked and she said yes.

1515
01:46:57,860 --> 01:46:59,903
Promise me, Red,

1516
01:46:59,987 --> 01:47:01,988
if you ever get out,

1517
01:47:02,073 --> 01:47:04,115
find that spot.

1518
01:47:05,159 --> 01:47:07,890
At the base of that
wall, you'll find a rock that

1519
01:47:07,891 --> 01:47:10,622
has no earthly business in a Maine hayfield.

1520
01:47:10,706 --> 01:47:13,208
A piece of black, volcanic glass.

1521
01:47:16,378 --> 01:47:19,172
There's something buried under it
I want you to have.

1522
01:47:19,256 --> 01:47:21,257
What, Andy?

1523
01:47:21,342 --> 01:47:23,426
What's buried under there?

1524
01:47:25,222 --> 01:47:28,599
You'll have to pry it up to see.

1525
01:47:33,939 --> 01:47:36,023
No, I'm telling you, the guy is...

1526
01:47:37,067 --> 01:47:39,151
He's talking funnier.

1527
01:47:39,236 --> 01:47:42,613
- I'm really worried about him.
- We ought to keep an eye on him.

1528
01:47:42,697 --> 01:47:46,742
That's fine during the day,
but at night he's got that cell all to himself.

1529
01:47:47,828 --> 01:47:49,286
Oh, Lord.

1530
01:47:49,371 --> 01:47:51,413
What?

1531
01:47:53,083 --> 01:47:55,417
Andy come down to the loading dock today.

1532
01:47:55,502 --> 01:47:59,004
- He asked me for a length of rope.
- Rope?

1533
01:47:59,089 --> 01:48:00,923
Six feet long.

1534
01:48:01,007 --> 01:48:02,466
And you gave it to him?

1535
01:48:02,551 --> 01:48:05,219
Sure I did. Why wouldn't I?

1536
01:48:05,220 --> 01:48:06,929
Jesus, Heywood.

1537
01:48:07,013 --> 01:48:09,265
Hey, how the hell was I supposed to know?

1538
01:48:09,349 --> 01:48:11,267
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1539
01:48:11,351 --> 01:48:12,393
No.

1540
01:48:13,436 --> 01:48:15,646
Andy would never do that.

1541
01:48:15,647 --> 01:48:17,731
Never.

1542
01:48:18,775 --> 01:48:20,860
I don't know.

1543
01:48:22,905 --> 01:48:24,990
Every man has his breaking point.

1544
01:48:27,618 --> 01:48:28,869
Lickety-split.

1545
01:48:28,953 --> 01:48:31,830
- I want to get home.
- Just about finished, sir.

1546
01:48:47,930 --> 01:48:50,015
Three deposits tonight.

1547
01:48:58,399 --> 01:49:00,483
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1548
01:49:00,484 --> 01:49:03,945
And shine my shoes.
I want 'em looking like mirrors.

1549
01:49:04,030 --> 01:49:05,405
Yes, sir.

1550
01:49:10,703 --> 01:49:12,370
It's good having you back, Andy.

1551
01:49:12,455 --> 01:49:15,207
The place wasn't the same without you.

1552
01:50:02,256 --> 01:50:05,007
Lights out!

1553
01:50:35,748 --> 01:50:38,041
I've had some long nights in stir.

1554
01:50:39,085 --> 01:50:41,795
Alone in the dark with
nothing but your thoughts,

1555
01:50:41,879 --> 01:50:43,714
time can draw out like a blade.

1556
01:50:50,096 --> 01:50:52,431
That was the longest night of my life.

1557
01:51:08,573 --> 01:51:10,198
Give me a count.

1558
01:51:14,537 --> 01:51:16,580
Tier 3 South. Clear.

1559
01:51:16,664 --> 01:51:17,999
Tier 4 North. Clear.

1560
01:51:18,083 --> 01:51:21,669
- Tier 3 North. Clear.
- Man missing on Tier 2.

1561
01:51:21,754 --> 01:51:24,839
- Cell 245.
- Dufresne.

1562
01:51:24,923 --> 01:51:27,842
Get your ass out here, boy.
You're holding up the show.

1563
01:51:30,346 --> 01:51:34,390
Don't make me come down there.
I'll thump your skull for you.

1564
01:51:41,982 --> 01:51:45,360
Damn it, Dufresne, you're putting me behind!
I got a schedule to keep.

1565
01:51:45,444 --> 01:51:48,529
You'd better be sick or dead in there,
I shit you not!

1566
01:51:48,614 --> 01:51:50,448
You hear me?

1567
01:51:56,955 --> 01:51:59,040
Oh, my holy God.

1568
01:52:15,892 --> 01:52:18,602
I want every man on this cell block questioned.

1569
01:52:18,603 --> 01:52:20,813
- Start with that friend of his.
- Who?

1570
01:52:20,897 --> 01:52:22,106
Him!

1571
01:52:24,025 --> 01:52:26,110
Open 237.

1572
01:52:29,114 --> 01:52:31,240
What do you mean, he just wasn't here?

1573
01:52:31,324 --> 01:52:32,866
Don't say that to me, Haig.

1574
01:52:32,951 --> 01:52:35,202
Don't say that to me again.

1575
01:52:35,286 --> 01:52:36,370
But, sir, he wasn't.

1576
01:52:36,454 --> 01:52:38,622
I can see that, Haig!

1577
01:52:38,706 --> 01:52:40,499
You think I'm blind?

1578
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:43,627
Is that what you're saying? Am I blind, Haig?

1579
01:52:43,711 --> 01:52:44,711
No, sir.

1580
01:52:44,796 --> 01:52:46,839
What about you?

1581
01:52:46,923 --> 01:52:48,757
Are you blind?

1582
01:52:48,842 --> 01:52:51,385
- Tell me what this is.
- Last night's count.

1583
01:52:51,469 --> 01:52:54,763
You see Dufresne's name there?
I sure do. See? Right there.

1584
01:52:54,848 --> 01:52:56,723
Dufresne.

1585
01:52:57,976 --> 01:52:59,643
He was in his cell at lights out.

1586
01:52:59,727 --> 01:53:02,938
It stands to reason
he'd still be here in the morning.

1587
01:53:04,023 --> 01:53:05,899
I want him found.

1588
01:53:05,984 --> 01:53:08,569
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast.

1589
01:53:08,653 --> 01:53:09,695
Now!

1590
01:53:09,696 --> 01:53:11,196
Yes, sir!

1591
01:53:12,323 --> 01:53:14,909
Let's go, let's go!
Move your butts! Move it!

1592
01:53:17,746 --> 01:53:18,788
Stand.

1593
01:53:19,915 --> 01:53:21,166
Well?

1594
01:53:24,545 --> 01:53:25,670
Well, what?

1595
01:53:25,754 --> 01:53:29,215
I see you two all the time.
You're thick as thieves, you are.

1596
01:53:30,259 --> 01:53:31,885
He must have said something.

1597
01:53:31,969 --> 01:53:34,012
No, sir, Warden.

1598
01:53:34,096 --> 01:53:35,555
Not a word.

1599
01:53:37,558 --> 01:53:39,559
Lord, it's a miracle!

1600
01:53:40,603 --> 01:53:43,062
A man up and vanished like a fart in the wind.

1601
01:53:43,147 --> 01:53:44,898
Nothing left but...

1602
01:53:44,982 --> 01:53:47,901
some damn rocks on a windowsill.

1603
01:53:47,985 --> 01:53:49,736
And that cupcake on the wall.

1604
01:53:49,820 --> 01:53:51,446
Let's ask her.

1605
01:53:51,530 --> 01:53:55,492
Maybe she knows. What say there,
Fuzzy Britches? Feel like talking?

1606
01:53:56,577 --> 01:53:57,660
Ah...

1607
01:53:57,661 --> 01:53:59,120
I guess not.

1608
01:53:59,205 --> 01:54:02,081
Why should she be any different?

1609
01:54:02,166 --> 01:54:04,626
This is a conspiracy.

1610
01:54:04,710 --> 01:54:06,920
That's what this is.

1611
01:54:07,004 --> 01:54:08,546
One big...

1612
01:54:08,631 --> 01:54:11,383
damn conspiracy!

1613
01:54:11,468 --> 01:54:14,136
And everyone's in on it!

1614
01:54:14,221 --> 01:54:15,513
Including her!

1615
01:54:50,173 --> 01:54:52,049
In 1966,

1616
01:54:52,133 --> 01:54:54,802
Andy Dufresne escaped

1617
01:54:54,886 --> 01:54:56,971
from Shawshank Prison.

1618
01:54:58,640 --> 01:55:01,392
All they found of him
was a muddy set of prison clothes,

1619
01:55:01,476 --> 01:55:03,519
a bar of soap

1620
01:55:03,603 --> 01:55:07,982
and an old rock hammer
damn near worn down to the nub.

1621
01:55:12,363 --> 01:55:17,200
I remember thinking it would take a man
600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.

1622
01:55:17,285 --> 01:55:19,995
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

1623
01:55:38,556 --> 01:55:40,640
Oh, Andy loved geology.

1624
01:55:41,684 --> 01:55:45,186
I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.

1625
01:55:45,271 --> 01:55:47,564
An Ice Age here,

1626
01:55:47,648 --> 01:55:50,233
a million years of mountain-building there.

1627
01:55:51,277 --> 01:55:53,695
Geology is the study of pressure and time.

1628
01:55:54,905 --> 01:55:56,948
That's all it takes, really.

1629
01:55:57,033 --> 01:55:59,075
Pressure...

1630
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:01,036
and time.

1631
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:04,456
That and a big goddamn poster.

1632
01:56:07,669 --> 01:56:09,045
Like I said,

1633
01:56:09,046 --> 01:56:12,840
in prison, a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1634
01:56:15,636 --> 01:56:20,806
It turns out Andy's favorite hobby
was toting his wall out into the exercise yard.

1635
01:56:20,891 --> 01:56:22,975
A handful at a time.

1636
01:56:24,811 --> 01:56:26,979
I guess after Tommy was killed,

1637
01:56:27,064 --> 01:56:29,899
Andy decided he'd been here
just about long enough.

1638
01:56:29,983 --> 01:56:32,193
Lickety-split. I want to get home.

1639
01:56:33,487 --> 01:56:35,571
I'm just about finished, sir.

1640
01:56:56,968 --> 01:56:59,053
Three deposits tonight.

1641
01:57:06,229 --> 01:57:08,271
Andy did like he was told.

1642
01:57:09,315 --> 01:57:12,818
Buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine.

1643
01:57:16,406 --> 01:57:18,448
The guard simply didn't notice.

1644
01:57:18,533 --> 01:57:20,575
Neither did I.

1645
01:57:20,660 --> 01:57:24,996
I mean, seriously, how often
do you really look at a man's shoes?

1646
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:35,212
Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards
of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.

1647
01:59:36,548 --> 01:59:38,549
Or maybe I just don't want to.

1648
01:59:43,263 --> 01:59:45,472
500 yards.

1649
01:59:46,516 --> 01:59:49,017
That's the length of five football fields.

1650
01:59:50,061 --> 01:59:52,312
Just shy of half a mile.

1651
02:00:47,536 --> 02:00:52,081
The next morning, right about the time
Raquel was spilling her little secret,

1652
02:00:52,166 --> 02:00:55,585
a man nobody ever laid eyes on before

1653
02:00:55,669 --> 02:00:58,088
strode into the Maine National Bank.

1654
02:00:58,173 --> 02:01:00,215
Until that moment,

1655
02:01:00,300 --> 02:01:02,176
he didn't exist,

1656
02:01:02,260 --> 02:01:03,594
except on paper.

1657
02:01:03,678 --> 02:01:04,720
May I help you?

1658
02:01:04,804 --> 02:01:06,847
He had all the proper ID,

1659
02:01:06,932 --> 02:01:10,559
driver's license, birth certificate,
social security card.

1660
02:01:10,644 --> 02:01:13,938
And the signature was a spot-on match.

1661
02:01:14,022 --> 02:01:17,066
I must say, I'm sorry
to be losing your business.

1662
02:01:17,150 --> 02:01:19,151
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1663
02:01:19,235 --> 02:01:21,028
Thank you.

1664
02:01:21,112 --> 02:01:22,905
I'm sure I will.

1665
02:01:22,989 --> 02:01:25,115
Here's your cashier's check, sir.

1666
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:27,242
Will there be anything else?

1667
02:01:27,327 --> 02:01:28,327
Please...

1668
02:01:28,411 --> 02:01:31,497
Would you add this to your outgoing mail?

1669
02:01:31,581 --> 02:01:33,791
I'd be happy to.

1670
02:01:33,875 --> 02:01:36,210
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.

1671
02:01:36,294 --> 02:01:41,090
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks
in the Portland area that morning.

1672
02:01:42,258 --> 02:01:48,722
All told, he blew town with better than $370,000
of Warden Norton's money.

1673
02:01:48,807 --> 02:01:51,266
Severance pay for 19 years.

1674
02:01:59,402 --> 02:02:01,695
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

1675
02:02:54,416 --> 02:02:57,418
Byron Hadley?
You have the right to remain silent.

1676
02:02:57,502 --> 02:02:59,816
If you give up the right
to remain silent, anything

1677
02:02:59,817 --> 02:03:02,131
you say will be held against you in court.

1678
02:03:02,215 --> 02:03:04,091
I wasn't there to see it.

1679
02:03:04,176 --> 02:03:09,055
But I hear Byron Hadley started sobbing
like a little girl when they took him away.

1680
02:03:14,478 --> 02:03:17,271
Norton had no intention of going that quietly.

1681
02:03:33,246 --> 02:03:34,705
Samuel Norton?

1682
02:03:34,790 --> 02:03:38,042
We have a warrant for your arrest. Open up.

1683
02:03:40,921 --> 02:03:42,046
Norton!

1684
02:03:42,130 --> 02:03:43,798
Open the door.

1685
02:03:43,882 --> 02:03:45,633
I'm not sure which key it is.

1686
02:03:48,512 --> 02:03:50,179
Norton!

1687
02:03:55,645 --> 02:03:57,729
Make it easy on yourself, Norton.

1688
02:04:09,033 --> 02:04:12,619
I like to think
the last thing that went through his head,

1689
02:04:12,703 --> 02:04:14,412
other than that bullet,

1690
02:04:14,497 --> 02:04:18,500
was to wonder how the hell
Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

1691
02:04:20,169 --> 02:04:21,253
Carter, James...

1692
02:04:21,337 --> 02:04:24,714
Not long after the Warden
deprived us of his company,

1693
02:04:24,799 --> 02:04:27,050
I got a postcard in the mail.

1694
02:04:28,761 --> 02:04:31,179
It was blank but the postmark said...

1695
02:04:31,264 --> 02:04:34,015
Fort Hancock, Texas.

1696
02:04:34,100 --> 02:04:36,143
Fort Hancock.

1697
02:04:36,227 --> 02:04:38,270
Right on the border.

1698
02:04:38,354 --> 02:04:40,397
That's where Andy crossed.

1699
02:04:40,481 --> 02:04:44,359
When I picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down,

1700
02:04:45,403 --> 02:04:47,487
it always makes me laugh.

1701
02:04:48,906 --> 02:04:50,950
Andy Dufresne,

1702
02:04:51,034 --> 02:04:53,411
who crawled through a river of shit

1703
02:04:53,495 --> 02:04:55,580
and came out clean on the other side.

1704
02:04:56,790 --> 02:04:58,833
Andy Dufresne,

1705
02:04:58,917 --> 02:05:00,835
headed for the Pacific.

1706
02:05:03,422 --> 02:05:05,464
Hadley's got him by the toes, right?

1707
02:05:05,549 --> 02:05:09,760
And he says, "I believe this boy's
about to have himself an accident."

1708
02:05:09,845 --> 02:05:13,014
Those of us who knew him best
talk about him often.

1709
02:05:13,098 --> 02:05:15,349
I swear, the stuff he pulled...

1710
02:05:15,434 --> 02:05:17,935
"These friends of mine
could use a couple of beers!"

1711
02:05:18,020 --> 02:05:20,104
- And he got it.
- And he got it!

1712
02:05:21,273 --> 02:05:23,649
Sometimes it makes me sad, though,

1713
02:05:23,734 --> 02:05:25,776
Andy being gone.

1714
02:05:25,861 --> 02:05:29,864
I have to remind myself
that some birds aren't meant to be caged.

1715
02:05:30,949 --> 02:05:33,034
Their feathers are just too bright.

1716
02:05:34,578 --> 02:05:36,621
And when they fly away,

1717
02:05:36,705 --> 02:05:40,625
the part of you that knows
it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

1718
02:05:42,377 --> 02:05:43,836
But still...

1719
02:05:43,921 --> 02:05:48,091
the place you live in is that much more drab
and empty that they're gone.

1720
02:05:52,639 --> 02:05:54,890
I guess I just miss my friend.

1721
02:06:18,873 --> 02:06:20,749
Please sit down.

1722
02:06:26,339 --> 02:06:28,465
Ellis Boyd Redding.

1723
02:06:28,549 --> 02:06:31,927
Your files say you've served
40 years of a life sentence.

1724
02:06:32,011 --> 02:06:34,388
Do you feel you've been rehabilitated?

1725
02:06:36,516 --> 02:06:38,600
Rehabilitated?

1726
02:06:40,144 --> 02:06:42,229
Well, now, let me see.

1727
02:06:43,273 --> 02:06:45,607
You know, I don't have any idea
what that means.

1728
02:06:47,403 --> 02:06:49,946
Well, it means you're ready to rejoin society...

1729
02:06:50,030 --> 02:06:52,573
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1730
02:06:54,952 --> 02:06:57,036
To me, it's just a made-up word.

1731
02:06:58,080 --> 02:07:00,331
A politician's word so that...

1732
02:07:00,416 --> 02:07:05,920
young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie and have a job.

1733
02:07:08,340 --> 02:07:10,425
What do you really want to know?

1734
02:07:11,593 --> 02:07:13,511
Am I sorry for what I did?

1735
02:07:13,595 --> 02:07:15,305
Well, are you?

1736
02:07:16,932 --> 02:07:19,517
There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.

1737
02:07:21,103 --> 02:07:24,230
Not because I'm in here
or because you think I should.

1738
02:07:28,027 --> 02:07:30,111
I look back on the way I was then.

1739
02:07:32,698 --> 02:07:34,741
A young...

1740
02:07:34,825 --> 02:07:37,910
stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.

1741
02:07:41,749 --> 02:07:43,833
I wanna talk to him.

1742
02:07:45,211 --> 02:07:47,379
I wanna try and talk some sense to him,

1743
02:07:48,423 --> 02:07:50,507
tell him the way things are.

1744
02:07:52,677 --> 02:07:54,762
But I can't.

1745
02:07:55,972 --> 02:07:58,057
That kid's long gone.

1746
02:07:59,351 --> 02:08:01,435
This old man is all that's left.

1747
02:08:03,563 --> 02:08:05,064
I gotta live with that.

1748
02:08:06,399 --> 02:08:08,192
Rehabilitated?

1749
02:08:08,276 --> 02:08:10,277
It's just a bullshit word.

1750
02:08:10,362 --> 02:08:16,283
So you go on and stamp your form, sonny,
and stop wasting my time.

1751
02:08:17,369 --> 02:08:19,411
Because to tell you the truth,

1752
02:08:19,496 --> 02:08:21,997
I don't give a shit.

1753
02:09:48,211 --> 02:09:50,296
Here you go, miss.

1754
02:09:52,299 --> 02:09:53,757
Rest room break, boss?

1755
02:09:59,806 --> 02:10:04,101
You don't need to ask me every time you need
to go take a piss. Just go. Understand?

1756
02:10:05,312 --> 02:10:06,979
Yes, sir.

1757
02:10:17,032 --> 02:10:20,075
40 years
I've been asking permission to piss.

1758
02:10:21,077 --> 02:10:23,287
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

1759
02:10:27,417 --> 02:10:29,502
There's a harsh truth to face.

1760
02:10:31,463 --> 02:10:33,797
No way I'm gonna make it on the outside.

1761
02:10:42,016 --> 02:10:45,477
All I do any more
is think of ways to break my parole...

1762
02:10:46,521 --> 02:10:48,605
..so maybe they'd send me back.

1763
02:10:54,111 --> 02:10:56,196
A terrible thing to live in fear.

1764
02:10:57,573 --> 02:11:00,951
Brooks Hatlen knew it, knew it all too well.

1765
02:11:03,120 --> 02:11:05,914
All I want is to be back
where things make sense,

1766
02:11:06,958 --> 02:11:09,459
where I won't have to be afraid all the time.

1767
02:11:12,338 --> 02:11:14,422
Only one thing stops me.

1768
02:11:15,466 --> 02:11:17,551
A promise I made to Andy.

1769
02:11:38,282 --> 02:11:40,366
Here it is.

1770
02:11:50,168 --> 02:11:52,253
Much obliged, sir.

1771
02:15:31,060 --> 02:15:32,352
Dear Red,

1772
02:15:32,436 --> 02:15:34,896
if you're reading this, you've gotten out.

1773
02:15:34,980 --> 02:15:39,234
And if you've come this far,
maybe you're willing to come a little further.

1774
02:15:39,318 --> 02:15:41,903
You remember the name of the town, don't you?

1775
02:15:44,198 --> 02:15:46,282
Zihuatanejo.

1776
02:15:47,326 --> 02:15:48,535
I could use a good man

1777
02:15:48,619 --> 02:15:50,662
to help me get my project on wheels.

1778
02:15:50,746 --> 02:15:52,872
I'll keep an eye out for you

1779
02:15:52,957 --> 02:15:54,999
and the chessboard ready.

1780
02:15:56,043 --> 02:15:57,418
Remember, Red,

1781
02:15:57,503 --> 02:15:59,546
hope is a good thing.

1782
02:15:59,630 --> 02:16:01,673
Maybe the best of things.

1783
02:16:01,757 --> 02:16:03,842
And no good thing ever dies.

1784
02:16:04,885 --> 02:16:07,345
I will be hoping that this letter finds you

1785
02:16:07,429 --> 02:16:09,472
and finds you well.

1786
02:16:09,557 --> 02:16:12,058
Your friend, Andy.

1787
02:16:46,636 --> 02:16:50,514
Get busy living or get busy dying.

1788
02:16:53,018 --> 02:16:55,102
That's goddamn right.

1789
02:17:00,609 --> 02:17:02,735
For the second time in my life,

1790
02:17:02,819 --> 02:17:04,904
I'm guilty of committing a crime.

1791
02:17:06,573 --> 02:17:08,657
Parole violation.

1792
02:17:08,658 --> 02:17:12,369
Of course, I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.

1793
02:17:13,622 --> 02:17:15,664
Not for an old crook like me.

1794
02:17:15,749 --> 02:17:17,833
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1795
02:17:21,546 --> 02:17:25,675
I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still
or hold a thought in my head.

1796
02:17:26,719 --> 02:17:29,721
I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.

1797
02:17:29,805 --> 02:17:32,515
A free man at the start of a long journey

1798
02:17:32,600 --> 02:17:35,518
whose conclusion is uncertain.

1799
02:17:38,397 --> 02:17:40,565
I hope I can make it across the border.

1800
02:17:42,443 --> 02:17:45,236
I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.

1801
02:17:47,615 --> 02:17:50,825
I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.

1802
02:17:53,579 --> 02:17:55,455
I hope.
